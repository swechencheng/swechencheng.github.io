<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>When we visited our family in another country, my wife purchased a really advanced robot vacuum cleaner which can also mop the floor as well as cross the door threshold.
Moreover, it has AI voice control, e.g., I can ask it to just clean a specific area such as near the cat litter box.
This kind of robot is not available in any European market, due to the fact that tech companies in Europe mostly don’t do rat race like some other top countries do. So we usually buy some smart devices when we do family visit and take the smart devices with us back to Sweden.</p>

<p>Here is the <strong>problem</strong>: This brand new shiny robot cleaner is Geo-fenced! And we cannot use it here at our nice home!</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-solution">What is the solution?</h1>

<p>Since most robots usually does not use real GPS signal for geofencing (the reason could be cost reduction for manufacturer, and GPS works bad inddor), I think it should be IP based geofencing.
Then it is easy to solve the problem with a VPN.</p>

<p>But I cannot install a VPN on a robot, since I don’t want to break the official firmware.
So I have to make a VPN router to let the robot connect to, and the robot’s network traffic should be automatically directed through the VPN.</p>

<p>For me another <strong>key point</strong> is: I don’t want to pay any VPN service provider, since I <strong>DON’T TRUST</strong> any 3rd party VPN service provider from the geofencing country. So I need to choose a good enough one.
Comnon VPN solutions such as <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">Wireguard</a> and <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> are already censored and blocked in the geofencing country. So I have to choose alternatives.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zerotier.com/">Zerotier</a> could be the one. And I have been using it a lot for my other devices for many years. It’s a perfect private networking overlay. But I found some guys saying that Zerotier is not stable in the geofencing country.
They mention that <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> is a good solution. And one can set it up on any device, Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and even an <em>Apple TV</em>… Okay fair enough. Let’s go ahead with Tailscale then.</p>

<p>To enable Tailscale VPN, one have to setup an <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes">exit node</a>.
And one need to run Tailscale client on the other device which want to have VPN access.</p>

<p>Normally, people would install a Tailscale exit node (such as <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>) in the geofencing country. But I am not physically feasible to do this. So I decide to choose a VPS cloud provider and use a VPS instance to run Tailscale as a exit node.
Actually it is super cheap to use Alibaba as a VPS cloud provider. They offer <strong>3 month free trial</strong> with an economic VPS instance in the geofencing country, and then charge people only around <strong>$10-20 USD every year</strong> after free trial is over.</p>

<p>I also need a Tailscale VPN router here at my home. Unfortunately I am not the rule maker at home, so I cannot change our nice router into OpenWRT because we want to stick with factory stock firmware.
And I also want to keep everything cheap and tidy. Luckily I found out that I have an old long-forgotten Raspberry Pi 3B slumbering for years in a neglected corner of the study.
That’s it! Since I only need to route a robot which is an embedded device, there is no requirement for a high speed network required by streaming or gaming.</p>

<p>So here would be the setup:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A modem provided by ISP to give Internet access.</li>
  <li>A home router which is for normal usage. Several devices connect to the router.</li>
  <li>A remote Tailscale exit node which runs on a VPS in the geofencing country to provide the VPN access to the Internet in that country.</li>
  <li>A RPi 3B VPN router which runs Tailscale and uses the Tailscale exit node in the other country. This RPi also runs <a href="https://w1.fi/hostapd/">hostapd</a> where the robot connects to, and forward all the traffic from host AP to the Tailscale exit node, so that my luxury robot will “think” itself as in the geofencing country.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="detailed-or-not-so-guide-to-setup-everything">Detailed (or not so?) guide to setup everything</h1>

<h2 id="first-build-my-own-vps-tailscale-exit-node">First, build my own VPS Tailscale exit node</h2>

<p>Run a VPS instance and <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1347/installation">install Tailscale</a>.
Follow <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes">this guide</a> to setup exit node.
One might find out that DNS will be “broken” after enabling Tailscale.
So pay attention to the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1188/linux-dns#common-problems">common problems</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure I don’t see any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tailscale health check</code> when I run:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>tailscale status
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I cannot be very detailed here because everyone has their own preference towards a cloud VPS service. And there are tons of guides out there on the Internet, so I decide to skip this chapter.</p>

<h2 id="second-build-my-rpi-vpn-router">Second, build my RPi VPN router</h2>

<p>Here I start with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/">RaspberryPi OS <strong>Lite</strong></a>.
Because My RPi 3B is too old, I want the system to be very small and efficient.</p>

<p>Then remove the NetworkManager… (You can ask AI why?)</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt remove network-manager
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1140756/124652877-7e713e00-de51-11eb-9973-09be5be1f069.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>NetworkManager is heavy, bloaty, and sometimes has conflict with <a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/2334">Tailscale DNS race condition</a>.
Again I want the system to be very efficient.</p>

<p>I use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemd-networkd</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemd-resolvd</code> instead. Install them if not:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>systemd-networkd systemd-resolvd
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hostapd</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>hostapd
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now I can specify my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Interface and driver
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211

# Network name and mode
ssid=MyVpnAP
hw_mode=g
channel=6 # Less likely to overlap with other WiFi
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0

# Security
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=MyStrongEnoughPassword
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP

# Country code (important for location spoofing)
country_code=CN # Oops, now everyone know which geofencing country it is...
ieee80211d=1
ieee80211h=1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Install the dnsmasq to manage the DHCP and DNS on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wlan0</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>dnsmasq
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And I want to avoid <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemd-resolved</code> to manage <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wlan0</code>, which will cause conflict.
So I specify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/systemd/network/10-wlan0.network</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[Match]
Name=wlan0

[Network]
Address=192.168.4.1/24
IPForward=yes
DHCPServer=no
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And specify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/dnsmasq.conf</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Don't let dnsmasq poll /etc/resolv.conf or other resolv
no-poll

# Upstream DNS Servers
server=100.100.100.100 # Tailscale
server=223.5.5.5       # Alibaba
server=1.1.1.1         # Cloudflare

# Only for wlan0 (which used by hostapd)
interface=wlan0
bind-interfaces
listen-address=192.168.4.1

# Override the default route supplied by dnsmasq, which assumes the
# router is the same machine as the one running dnsmasq.
dhcp-option=3,192.168.4.1
# Enable the integrated DHCP server
dhcp-range=192.168.4.2,192.168.4.50,255.255.255.0,24h

# Slightly bigger cache size than default 150
cache-size=1000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now my host AP will have a gateway IP address <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.4.1</code>,
and my clients which connect to the AP will have IP address from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.4.2</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.4.50</code>.
I force the DNS to be a Tailscale DNS or fall back to Alibaba’s DNS so the host AP can be a really nice target geo.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dnsmasq</code> is convenient for me to do very specific setup on host AP.
Thus host AP can be <strong>“geo-fencing”</strong> as the target country.</p>

<p>And I let <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemd-resolved</code> to manage the rest of the network interfaces.</p>

<p>Remember to add this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/systemd/network/10-eth0.network</code> for Ethernet cable:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[Match]
Name=eth0

[Network]
DHCP=yes
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s better to reboot my RPi once to apply those settings before proceed with Tailscale.</p>

<p>After reboot, <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1347/installation">install Tailscale</a>.
Bring Tailscale online and solve <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1188/linux-dns#common-problems">common problems</a>.
My Tailscale should <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes?tab=linux#use-the-exit-node">use the exit node</a> which I have set up in the previous chapter.</p>

<p>Make sure I don’t see any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tailscale health check</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>tailscale status
100.69.181.99   rpi-3b-tailscale     charles.cc.zhang@ linux   -
100.117.23.101  izbp15dsdfqo80wert7lm2z-1 charles.cc.zhang@ linux   active<span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">exit </span>node<span class="p">;</span> direct 114.215.188.166:41641, tx 60592228 rx 322398812
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here I have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpi-3b-tailscale</code> which stands for my RPi 3B, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">izbp15dsdfqo80wert7lm2z-1</code> for my VPS in the geofencing country.</p>

<p>Now it is time to setup the traffic forwarding from host AP to Tailscale.</p>

<p>Install iptables:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>iptables iptables-persistent
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Setup kernel parameters in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/sysctl.conf</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
net.ipv4.conf.tailscale0.forwarding=1
net.ipv4.conf.wlan0.forwarding=1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And apply:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>sysctl <span class="nt">-p</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add firewall rules:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.4.0/24 -o tailscale0 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i tailscale0 -o wlan0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.4.0/24 -o tailscale0 -j MASQUERADE

# This is very important to do TCP MSS clamping because Tailscale has a different mtu than wlan0
sudo iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -o tailscale0 -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1240
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now I have finished all the configurations!</p>

<p>Oh well, save my iptables to make it persistent:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, even if there is a power outrage, my RPi VPN tunnel will automatically come back after a reboot.</p>

<h2 id="test-the-outcome">Test the outcome</h2>

<p>I can use my mobile to connect to my host AP <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MyVpnAP</code>, then just visit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifconfig.me</code>.
And I get the correct IP which is in the geofencing target country.</p>

<p>I even opened a specific geofencing live streaming APP from that country and stream a little bit. For the first half minute it was fine, but then it became choppy and the AP WiFi broke. 
Oh my poor RPi 3B…</p>

<p>But the AP immediately came back afterwards once I stop the streaming APP.
This RPi VPN router is not for heavy duty for sure.</p>

<p>Our luxury robot cleaner is now happily working, the only thing we have not let it try is to let it open its camera and automatically chase my nice little cat. I think this functionality is too heavy for my RPi VPN router.</p>

<p>So far I have <strong>not</strong> spent <strong>a single penny</strong> because I am reusing my old devices, and the VPS exit node is still on free trial.
After the trial period over, I am more than willing to pay Alibaba $10-20 a year for keep the VPS up and running as an Tailscale exit node.</p>

<h1 id="caveat">Caveat</h1>

<p>For most robot’s manufacturer’s controlling APP, it is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> to also connect to the RPi VPN router’s AP while you do the configuration towards your robot.
This is to make sure your real IP won’t leak from your mobile APP to the manufacturer.</p>

<h1 id="a-better-approach">A better approach</h1>

<p>RPi router is not optimal for wireless.
<a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/vpn/tailscale/start">OpenWRT with Tailscale</a> is much better in every aspect, e.g. coverage and performance.
If OpenWRT is available, don’t hesitate to replace the RPi with it!</p>

<p>Hope this blog finds someone who needs it.

<p>It is a demo of using Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Research for <strong>free</strong>, which is really interesting and crazy base on recent Google AI release.</p>

<p>I do buy some stocks as hobby. But I always loose money, especially this year April.</p>

<p>AI is evolving in an unbelievable speed. After I saw Google’s new AI release, and found that everyone can use Gemini Pro 2.5 for free, I believe that this will be very helpful.</p>

<p>So I start with a basic prompt:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Conduct a deep analysis of the 30 Swedish stocks within the OMX Stockholm 30 Index (OMXS30), and select the best 5-10 stocks at the current time.

For each stock, the deep analysis must include the following aspects:

1.  Financial condition
2.  Technological advantages and competitiveness
3.  Market trends
4.  Potential customers
5.  Main competitors
6.  Government and commercial contract situation
7.  Future strategy and risk factors
8.  Notable analyst comments and ratings
9.  Management's capability
10. Business model
11. Current market sentiment
12. Interpretation of recent earnings reports
13. Macroeconomic assessment: monetary policy, economic data, industry dynamics, etc.

Assign weights to the selected stocks to create an investment portfolio.
Clearly indicate the weight of each stock, current reference price, and specific take-profit and stop-loss strategies.

Please use Swedish or English materials for research, and present the final report in English.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And I ask Gemini to improve this prompt for me. And it gives me a really professional result:</p>

<h3 id="i-executive-summary"><strong>I. Executive Summary</strong></h3>

<h4 id="a-macroeconomic-and-market-outlook"><strong>A. Macroeconomic and Market Outlook</strong></h4>

<p>The global economic landscape presents a complex and evolving picture for 2025 and 2026. Global growth projections vary, with the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) January 2025 World Economic Outlook (WEO) projecting a stable 3.3% for both years, driven by an upward revision in the United States offsetting downward revisions elsewhere.1 However, the April 2025 IMF WEO presents a more cautious outlook, with global growth potentially dropping to 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, a cumulative downgrade of 0.8 percentage points from the January forecast, falling significantly below the historical average of 3.7% (2000-19).2 This deceleration is largely attributed to increased policy uncertainty, trade tensions, and softer demand momentum, particularly impacting the United States, where GDP growth is now expected to slow to 1.8% in 2025 from an earlier 2.7% projection.2 The Euro Area is also anticipated to experience a slowdown, with growth projected at 0.8% in 2025.2 China is expected to face significant downgrades in growth due to recent trade measures, although specific numerical projections are not provided.2</p>

<p>Global headline inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4.3% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026 according to the April WEO, a slightly slower pace than previously anticipated.2 Key risks to this global outlook include further escalation of trade wars, eroded policy buffers, financial market instability, demographic shifts, social unrest, and debt challenges in emerging markets.2 An upside potential exists if tariff rates de-escalate and trade policies gain clarity.2</p>

<p>For Sweden, the economic outlook for 2025 indicates a period of sluggish growth, with the European Commission forecasting real GDP growth at 1.1%.3 This recovery is expected to be delayed by global trade disruptions.3 Inflation is projected to remain just above 2% throughout 2025 (EC forecast: 2.2%), influenced by persistent food price rises partially offset by lower non-industrial goods and energy prices.3 Unemployment is expected to rise to 8.7% in 2025, reflecting a weak labor market amidst modest economic growth.3 Consumer confidence is anticipated to be weighed down by heightened uncertainty, consequently holding back private consumption and investment.3 The general government balance is projected to remain stable at -1.5% of GDP in 2025, due to continued substantial spending on infrastructure and defense, and slowing tax revenue growth.3</p>

<p>The Riksbank maintained its policy rate at 2.25% as of May 14, 2025, following a series of cuts that began in May 2024.4 While the Riksbank assesses monetary policy as “well-balanced” and prefers to “await further information,” it also notes a “somewhat more probable” scenario of lower inflation, which “could suggest a slight easing of monetary policy going forward”.6 This indicates a potential dovish bias, with market participants like Handelsbanken and Nordea anticipating further rate cuts in 2025.8</p>

<p>Currency trends present a mixed picture. The Swedish Krona (SEK) has recently strengthened, attributed by the Riksbank to a general weakening of the USD and a perception of Swedish assets as safe due to strong public finances.7 However, forecasts from major banks show divergence. Handelsbanken predicts a stronger SEK against both USD (9.15 by end-2025) and EUR (10.80 by end-2025).8 SEB also forecasts a stronger SEK against the EUR (10.60 by end-2025).10 Conversely, Nordea forecasts a notably weaker SEK against the EUR (11.40 by end-2025).9 This conflicting outlook underscores the importance of robust currency hedging strategies for OMXS30 multinationals.</p>

<p>The OMX Stockholm 30 Index (OMXS30) comprises the 30 largest and most actively traded stocks on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, weighted by market capitalization and rebalanced twice annually.11 The index has experienced recent declines, closing at 2,479.56 on May 22, 2025, with a 90-day performance of -6.48% and higher volatility compared to longer periods.13 The index has a significant weighting towards cyclical sectors such as industrials, manufacturing, and financials, which could face headwinds in a slowing global economy.11</p>

<h4 id="c-key-investment-themes-and-portfolio-rationale"><strong>C. Key Investment Themes and Portfolio Rationale</strong></h4>

<p>The selected investment opportunities are underpinned by several overarching themes designed to maximize risk-adjusted returns within a 1-3 year holding period, particularly in the context of a slowing global economy and a potentially dovish Riksbank.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Resilience in Uncertain Times:</strong> The portfolio prioritizes companies with proven operational efficiency, strong balance sheets, and the ability to maintain or improve profitability margins despite macroeconomic headwinds. For instance, Alfa Laval’s ability to boost margins even with declining organic orders, and Assa Abloy’s strategic cost management programs, demonstrate their capacity to navigate challenging environments.18 This resilience is crucial given the “sluggish growth” and “heightened uncertainty” in the Swedish and global economic outlooks.2</li>
  <li><strong>Exposure to Secular Growth Trends:</strong> The selected companies are positioned to benefit from long-term structural shifts, such as digitalization, automation, and sustainability. Evolution AB, for example, is a direct beneficiary of the global expansion of regulated online gaming and the digitalization of the industry.21 AstraZeneca is at the forefront of pharmaceutical innovation, driven by an aging global population and continuous advancements in medical science.22 Alfa Laval’s focus on sustainable solutions for energy, food, and water industries, including emerging markets like hydrogen and carbon dioxide, aligns with global environmental imperatives.23 Sandvik’s and Atlas Copco’s investments in automation, digitalization, and electrification for industrial applications tap into the broader Industry 4.0 trend.25 These secular trends provide a buffer against cyclical downturns, offering more predictable and sustained growth.</li>
  <li><strong>Strong Competitive Advantages (Moats):</strong> Each recommended company possesses durable competitive advantages that protect their market positions and profitability. This includes proprietary technology, strong brand recognition, extensive global distribution networks, high customer switching costs, and significant R&amp;D capabilities. For instance, Assa Abloy’s entrenched market leadership and continuous innovation in access solutions create substantial barriers to entry.27 Evolution’s technological infrastructure and operational excellence in live casino solutions are difficult to replicate.21 These competitive strengths enable companies to maintain pricing power and market share even in competitive environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Attractive Valuations (Relative and Intrinsic):</strong> While some companies may appear to trade at a premium, the analysis indicates that their valuations are justified by their quality and growth prospects, or that they are currently undervalued relative to their intrinsic worth or peers. Evolution, for example, appears undervalued compared to its direct gaming peers, suggesting potential for significant capital appreciation.21 Alfa Laval and Atlas Copco, despite some market headwinds, demonstrate strong underlying value when considering their long-term growth catalysts and financial health.28</li>
  <li><strong>Shareholder-Friendly Policies:</strong> Companies with a history of consistent dividend payments and/or share buyback programs are favored, indicating management’s confidence in future cash flows and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Alfa Laval, Assa Abloy, Evolution, Atlas Copco, and Sandvik all propose or have recently increased dividends, and some engage in share buybacks.18 This commitment to shareholder returns adds another layer of attractiveness, especially in a low-interest-rate environment where income generation is valued.</li>
</ol>

<p>This portfolio construction aims to balance stability with growth potential, mitigating macroeconomic risks by focusing on companies with strong fundamentals and exposure to powerful long-term trends.</p>

<h3 id="ii-global-and-swedish-macroeconomic-context"><strong>II. Global and Swedish Macroeconomic Context</strong></h3>

<h4 id="a-global-economic-outlook-gdp-growth-inflation-key-risks-eurozone-us-china"><strong>A. Global Economic Outlook: GDP Growth, Inflation, Key Risks (Eurozone, US, China)</strong></h4>

<p>The global economic trajectory for 2025 and 2026 is characterized by a general slowdown, accompanied by persistent inflationary pressures and heightened uncertainty. The January 2025 World Economic Outlook (WEO) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected global growth at 3.3% for both 2025 and 2026, a figure below the historical average of 3.7% (2000–19).1 This projection included an upward revision for the United States, which compensated for downward revisions in other major economies.1 However, a more recent assessment in the April 2025 IMF WEO indicates a further deceleration, with global growth potentially dropping to 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026.2 This represents a significant cumulative downgrade of 0.8 percentage points from the January forecast, underscoring the deteriorating global outlook.2</p>

<p>Global headline inflation is expected to decline gradually. The January WEO forecasted global headline inflation to reach 4.2% in 2025 and 3.5% in 2026.1 The April WEO slightly adjusted these figures to 4.3% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026, with notable upward revisions for advanced economies.2 This suggests that while disinflation is in progress, it may proceed at a slower pace than initially anticipated, particularly in developed markets.</p>

<p><strong>United States:</strong> The US economy, initially a bright spot, is now expected to face a more challenging period. The January WEO projected 2.7% GDP growth for 2025, driven by robust labor markets and accelerating investment.1 However, the April WEO significantly revised this down to 1.8% for 2025, citing increased policy uncertainty, escalating trade tensions, and softer demand momentum.2 Inflation is expected to remain close to, but above, the 2% target in 2025.1 A primary risk for the US stems from new waves of tariffs, which, by April 2, 2025, had brought effective tariff rates to levels not seen in a century.2 The potential for loose fiscal policy in the long run also poses a risk, as it could necessitate larger, potentially disruptive, fiscal adjustments and possibly weaken the US dollar’s role as a global safe asset.1</p>

<p><strong>Euro Area:</strong> Economic activity in the Euro Area is also expected to slow. The January WEO projected 1.0% GDP growth for 2025, a downward revision due to weaker momentum in manufacturing and heightened policy uncertainty.1 The April WEO further reduced this projection to 0.8% in 2025.2 Euro Area headline inflation is expected to reach the European Central Bank (ECB) target by mid-2025, averaging 2.1% in 2025.33 Key risks for the Euro Area include persistent geopolitical tensions and ongoing economic adjustments, particularly in the energy sector, which continue to weigh on sentiment and economic performance.1</p>

<p><strong>China:</strong> China’s growth trajectory is subject to significant uncertainty. While the January WEO marginally revised its 2025 GDP growth forecast upward to 4.6%, attributing it to carryover from 2024 and a fiscal package, this was set against a backdrop of property market drag and trade policy uncertainty.1 The April WEO indicates “significant downgrades” for China due to recent trade measures, though specific numerical projections are not provided.2 Low inflation is projected to persist in China.1 The primary risks for China include the ongoing adjustments in its real estate market, persistently low consumer confidence, and the impact of heightened trade policy uncertainty on investment.1</p>

<p><strong>Key Risks to the Global Outlook (General):</strong> The overarching global outlook is dominated by intensifying downside risks. These include a potential escalation of trade wars and even higher trade policy uncertainty, which could further reduce both near- and long-term growth.2 Eroded policy buffers in many economies diminish their resilience to future shocks.2 Financial market instability could manifest through asset repricing, sharp adjustments in foreign exchange rates, and volatile capital flows, particularly for economies already facing debt distress.2 Demographic shifts, such as a shrinking foreign labor force, may curb potential growth and threaten fiscal sustainability.2 The lingering effects of the cost-of-living crisis, combined with depleted policy space and dim medium-term growth prospects, could reignite social unrest.2 Furthermore, the resilience of many large emerging market economies may be tested as servicing high debt levels becomes more challenging in unfavorable global financial conditions.2</p>

<p><strong>Policy Implications:</strong> The path forward demands clear and coordinated policy responses. Countries are encouraged to work constructively to promote a stable and predictable trade environment, facilitate debt restructuring, and address shared global challenges.2 Monetary policy needs to remain proactive, with central banks potentially facing difficult trade-offs between managing inflation and supporting economic output, depending on whether demand shocks or supply-chain disruptions dominate.2 Fiscal authorities face stark choices due to high debt levels and rising financing costs, necessitating credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans while meeting essential spending needs.2 Efforts to boost total factor productivity through structural reforms and the adoption of new technologies like artificial intelligence are crucial for improving weak medium-term growth prospects.2</p>

<h4 id="b-swedish-economic-outlook-gdp-growth-inflation-unemployment-consumer-confidence"><strong>B. Swedish Economic Outlook: GDP Growth, Inflation, Unemployment, Consumer Confidence</strong></h4>

<p>The Swedish economy is projected to experience a period of subdued growth in 2025, with a recovery anticipated to gain momentum only in 2026. The European Commission forecasts real GDP growth to average 1.1% in 2025.3 This sluggish performance is largely attributed to global trade disruptions and heightened uncertainty, which are expected to delay a more robust recovery given the Swedish economy’s high degree of openness.3 Real GDP stagnated in the first quarter of 2025, reinforcing the expectation of a delayed upturn.3 Handelsbanken provides a slightly more optimistic forecast of 1.5% GDP growth for Sweden in 2025, while Nordea projects 1.6%.8</p>

<p>Consumer price inflation is expected to remain just above 2% throughout 2025, with the European Commission forecasting 2.2% for the year.3 This persistence is driven by continued increases in food prices, although these are partly offset by trade-induced decreases in non-industrial goods prices and lower energy costs.3 Handelsbanken anticipates CPIF inflation to hover around 2%, with CPIF excluding energy gradually moving towards 2%.8 Nordea’s forecast for CPIF inflation in 2025 stands at 1.8%.9</p>

<p>The labor market is expected to remain weak in response to the modest economic growth. The European Commission projects the unemployment rate to rise to 8.7% in 2025 before a gradual decline in 2026, following a lagged recovery in employment.3 Nordea’s unemployment forecast for 2025 is 8.4%.9 Heightened uncertainty is a significant factor weighing on both business and consumer confidence, which in turn is expected to restrain private consumption and investment.3</p>

<p>The general government balance is projected to remain stable at -1.5% of GDP in 2025.3 This is due to continued substantial government spending on infrastructure and defense, combined with a slowing growth in tax revenues.3</p>

<p>The macroeconomic environment presents a complex interplay of signals and challenges. While the IMF’s April WEO indicates a more pessimistic global growth trajectory, which directly impacts Sweden as an open economy, Swedish inflation remains somewhat elevated according to the Riksbank (CPIF at 2.3%, CPIF excluding energy at 3.1% in April).7 This creates a tension: a global slowdown and weak domestic demand could lead to lower inflation, but the ongoing trade conflicts and potential supply chain disruptions might exert upward pressure on prices.7 This intricate situation poses significant challenges for the Riksbank’s monetary policy decisions, as balancing these opposing forces is critical. Companies with substantial international exposure, especially to the US and Eurozone, are likely to face headwinds, while domestically focused businesses or those with strong pricing power may demonstrate greater resilience. The trajectory of inflation will be a key determinant for future Riksbank rate decisions, which will subsequently influence borrowing costs and consumer spending within Sweden.</p>

<h4 id="c-riksbank-monetary-policy-current-stance-interest-rate-outlook-forward-guidance"><strong>C. Riksbank Monetary Policy: Current Stance, Interest Rate Outlook, Forward Guidance</strong></h4>

<p>The Riksbank, Sweden’s central bank, has maintained a cautious but potentially dovish stance in its recent monetary policy decisions. As of May 14, 2025, the policy rate was held unchanged at 2.25%.4 This decision follows a series of rate cuts that commenced in May 2024, which saw the policy rate reduced from 4% to its current level of 2.25% by January 2025.6</p>

<p>The Riksbank’s Executive Board currently assesses monetary policy as “well-balanced” and deems it prudent to “await further information” to gain a clearer picture of the economic activity and inflation outlook.6 This indicates a desire for data-driven decisions and a cautious approach to further adjustments. However, a significant nuance in their forward guidance is the assessment that it is “somewhat more probable that inflation will be lower than that it will be higher than in the March forecast”.6 This particular phrasing suggests a leaning towards future monetary easing, as lower inflation would provide scope for rate cuts. The Riksbank explicitly states that this scenario “could suggest a slight easing of monetary policy going forward”.6</p>

<p>Major financial institutions in Sweden largely align with this expectation of future rate cuts. Handelsbanken, for instance, projects that the Riksbank will reduce the policy rate to 1.75% by the end of 2025, with anticipated cuts occurring in both June and August.8 Similarly, Nordea also expects a rate cut in June.36 This collective expectation from leading banks indicates a market consensus that, despite the Riksbank’s current wait-and-see approach, further monetary loosening is on the horizon.</p>

<p>The Riksbank’s Monetary Policy Update from May 2025 does not explicitly mention any current or planned Quantitative Easing (QE) or Quantitative Tightening (QT) programs.4 The primary focus of their communication and policy tools, as detailed in the provided information, remains on the policy rate.</p>

<p>The Riksbank’s dovish bias, even while maintaining the current policy rate, carries significant implications for the Swedish economy and the OMXS30. A declining interest rate environment typically serves to stimulate domestic demand, which could particularly benefit sectors that are sensitive to borrowing costs, such as real estate and consumer durables. Companies carrying high debt loads could also see a reduction in their financing expenses, thereby improving their profitability. Furthermore, a lower interest rate environment often leads to a weaker national currency, which would be advantageous for Sweden’s export-oriented companies, as their products become more competitive internationally and their foreign currency revenues translate into higher SEK values. This monetary policy stance, therefore, sets a supportive backdrop for certain segments of the Swedish equity market.</p>

<h4 id="d-currency-impact-sek-exchange-rate-trends-and-implications-for-omxs30-multinationals"><strong>D. Currency Impact: SEK Exchange Rate Trends and Implications for OMXS30 Multinationals</strong></h4>

<p>The trajectory of the Swedish Krona (SEK) exchange rate presents a complex and somewhat conflicting picture, with significant implications for the earnings and competitive positioning of OMXS30 multinationals. The Riksbank’s latest Monetary Policy Update from May 2025 observes that the SEK has continued to strengthen, aligning with its earlier March forecast.7 This strengthening is attributed to a general weakening of the US dollar and a perception of Swedish companies as competitive, alongside Swedish assets being viewed as relatively safe due to the nation’s strong public finances.7</p>

<p>However, forecasts from major banks regarding the SEK’s future direction against key currencies like the US dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR) show notable divergences.</p>

<p><strong>USD/SEK Forecasts:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>MUFG Research (April 2025):</strong> Projects the SEK/USD exchange rate at 10.472 for Q2 2025, 10.370 for Q3 2025, and 10.000 for Q4 2025.35 This indicates a strengthening of the SEK against the USD compared to MUFG’s earlier March 2025 forecast (which was 11.275 for Q2, 10.952 for Q3, and 10.556 for Q4).37</li>
  <li><strong>Handelsbanken (May 2025):</strong> Forecasts a stronger SEK against the USD, reaching 9.15 by the end of 2025.8</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EUR/SEK Forecasts:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Handelsbanken (May 2025):</strong> Predicts a stronger SEK against the EUR, with a forecast of 10.80 by the end of 2025.8</li>
  <li><strong>SEB (May 2025):</strong> Also forecasts a stronger SEK against the EUR, reaching 10.60 in December 2025.10</li>
  <li><strong>Nordea (May 2025):</strong> Presents a contrasting view, forecasting a notably weaker SEK against the EUR, with a projection of 11.40 by the end of 2025.9</li>
</ul>

<p>This divergence in currency forecasts creates a significant layer of uncertainty for OMXS30 multinationals. A strengthening SEK, as suggested by the Riksbank’s observations and some bank forecasts, can negatively impact the reported earnings of Swedish multinationals when their foreign currency revenues are translated back into SEK. This is particularly pertinent for companies with substantial international operations and revenue streams denominated in foreign currencies. Conversely, a weaker SEK, as Nordea’s forecast implies for the EUR/SEK pair, would benefit these companies, boosting their reported earnings and making their exports more competitive.</p>

<p>The conflicting outlooks from reputable financial institutions underscore the inherent volatility and unpredictability of currency markets. For OMXS30 multinationals, which often derive a significant portion of their revenue from international markets, this currency fluctuation risk is material. Consequently, robust currency hedging strategies become paramount to protect reported earnings and cash flows from adverse exchange rate movements. Investors evaluating these companies should closely scrutinize their foreign exchange exposure and the effectiveness of their hedging policies, as these factors can materially influence financial performance regardless of underlying operational strength.</p>

<p>The sectoral composition of the OMXS30 indicates a significant concentration in industrial, manufacturing, and financial sectors. These sectors are typically sensitive to economic cycles, meaning their performance tends to fluctuate in tandem with the broader economy. Given the prevailing macroeconomic outlook of “sluggish growth” and “uncertainty” globally and within Sweden 2, this sectoral weighting suggests that the index as a whole could face headwinds. This situation implies that a diversified investment portfolio within the OMXS30 should carefully consider balancing exposure to these cyclical sectors with more defensive companies or those demonstrating strong, unique growth catalysts that can outperform a challenging macroeconomic environment.</p>

<h4 id="b-recent-index-performance-and-volatility-analysis"><strong>B. Recent Index Performance and Volatility Analysis</strong></h4>

<p>The OMX Stockholm 30 Index has exhibited a mixed performance recently, characterized by short-term rebounds amidst a broader period of medium-term weakness and increased volatility. As of May 22, 2025, the index closed at 2,479.56, marking a daily decline of 0.88%.14 The previous day, May 21, 2025, saw a more significant drop of 1.82%, with the index closing at 2,501.57.14</p>

<p>Looking at broader timeframes, the index’s performance over the last 30 days shows a positive return of 7.77%.13 This short-term rebound might attract attention, suggesting a recovery in market sentiment. However, a different picture emerges when considering the 90-day performance, which stands at a negative 6.48%.13 This indicates that the recent positive momentum could be a temporary bounce within a larger period of underlying weakness.</p>

<p>Volatility metrics further support this assessment of market choppiness. The 30-day volatility for the OMXS30 is recorded at 14.51.13 In contrast, the 90-day volatility is notably higher at 26.01, and the 250-day volatility is 18.55.13 The higher 90-day volatility compared to both the shorter (30-day) and longer (250-day) periods suggests that the market has experienced increased fluctuations and unpredictability over the medium term. This pattern indicates that the recent short-term positive performance may not signal a sustained upward trend but rather a period of heightened market uncertainty.</p>

<p>For investors with a 1-3 year holding period, this market behavior carries an important implication. It suggests that caution is warranted against chasing recent rallies, as such movements might be short-lived. Instead, a prudent approach would involve focusing on companies with robust fundamentals and clear long-term growth drivers that are capable of weathering periods of increased market volatility and potential economic slowdowns. The prevailing market conditions necessitate a selective investment strategy that prioritizes quality and resilience over chasing short-term momentum.</p>

</ul>

<p>Most Recent Earnings Report (Q1 2025):</p>

<p>The Q1 2025 earnings report revealed mixed signals regarding demand but strong operational execution. Organic order intake declined by 3% to SEK 16.8 billion, partly influenced by a SEK 0.9 billion negative currency effect on the order book.18 However, net sales increased by 10% organically to SEK 16.5 billion, and adjusted EBITA grew by 20% to SEK 2.9 billion, with the margin improving to 17.7%.18 EPS rose to SEK 4.82.18 Cash flow from operating activities decreased to SEK 1.4 billion.18 A record service order intake of SEK 5.8 billion was noted.24 Management expects Q2 2025 demand to be similar to Q1, with strong demand in the Energy division and stable demand in Food and Water.18 Analysts generally hold a positive view, with Nasdaq highlighting Alfa Laval’s outperformance of the Construction sector and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), with full-year EPS estimates increasing by 8.4%.41 TipRanks indicates a “Moderate Buy” consensus and an average price target of SEK 444.90, representing a 6.02% upside.40</p>

<p>The company’s ability to maintain and improve margins despite a decline in organic order intake suggests strong operational execution and effective pricing strategies. This indicates that Alfa Laval is successfully converting its existing order backlog into revenue and enhancing profitability, even if new orders are showing some softness. The improved net debt to EBITDA ratio further reinforces the company’s robust financial position. The proposed dividend increase also signals management’s confidence in future performance.</p>

<h5 id="2-business-model--competitive-moat"><strong>2. Business Model &amp; Competitive Moat</strong></h5>

<p>Alfa Laval operates a business model centered on providing critical industrial solutions, underpinned by a strong competitive moat derived from its deep expertise, technological leadership, and extensive global presence.</p>

<p><strong>Core Business Model:</strong> Alfa Laval specializes in delivering products and solutions for heat transfer, separation, and fluid handling across diverse industries globally, primarily through its Energy, Food &amp; Water, and Marine divisions.39 The company’s objective is to help customers enhance their productivity and quality in a sustainable manner. This is achieved through a multi-channel distribution network, leveraging engineers with deep application knowledge to offer tailored solutions and comprehensive service and maintenance offerings.42</p>

<p><strong>Technological Advantages &amp; Innovation:</strong> Innovation is a cornerstone of Alfa Laval’s strategy. The company invests significantly in research and development, with R&amp;D expenditures corresponding to approximately 4% of total revenues.42 This investment is directed towards developing new and improved products that offer sustainable and tangible customer benefits, such as increased productivity, energy efficiency, and lower life-cycle costs.42 Alfa Laval protects its technical innovations through patents.42 The company’s history spans 140 years, during which it pioneered air compression technology and remains a leader in its core areas.38</p>

<p><strong>Competitive Positioning &amp; Market Share:</strong> Alfa Laval holds a leading position in all three of its core areas: heat transfer, separation, and fluid handling.38 Its market positions strengthened across almost all areas in 2024.23 The company has demonstrated outperformance compared to the broader Construction sector and the Engineering - R&amp;D Services industry on a year-to-date basis.41</p>

<p><strong>Barriers to Entry:</strong> The company’s competitive moat is deep-rooted, stemming from several factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Long History and Expertise:</strong> With 140 years of experience, Alfa Laval possesses a vast accumulation of knowledge and expertise in its specialized fields.38</li>
  <li><strong>Proprietary Technology and Patents:</strong> Its continuous innovation and patenting activities create proprietary technologies that are difficult for competitors to replicate.42</li>
  <li><strong>High Switching Costs:</strong> The critical nature of Alfa Laval’s products to industrial processes implies high switching costs for customers, as reliability and performance are paramount and replacing core components can be disruptive and expensive.38</li>
  <li><strong>Global Service Network:</strong> An extensive global service and maintenance business provides ongoing customer support and revenue stability.42</li>
</ul>

<p>Alfa Laval’s business model is inherently protected by these significant barriers to entry. By providing critical components for essential industrial processes, the company ensures high customer reliance on its products. This strong competitive moat, combined with its continuous investment in R&amp;D for sustainable solutions and a robust global service network, allows Alfa Laval to maintain pricing power and profitability even in challenging economic environments, as evidenced by its Q1 2025 performance. This strategic positioning is expected to drive long-term growth as industries increasingly seek more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly solutions.</p>

<h5 id="3-market--industry-dynamics"><strong>3. Market &amp; Industry Dynamics</strong></h5>

<p>Alfa Laval operates within dynamic industrial markets, strategically aligning its offerings with long-term global trends, particularly in sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>Industry Trends:</strong> The overarching industry trend driving Alfa Laval’s business is the increasing demand for sustainable solutions.23 This encompasses a broad range of customer needs for energy efficiency, reduced environmental impact, and optimized resource utilization across various industrial processes. However, the company has also experienced specific market weaknesses, such as in the HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) application, which faced low demand for heat pumps and a generally slow construction market in 2024.23</p>

<p><strong>Market Size &amp; Growth Potential:</strong> While specific total addressable market (TAM) figures are not provided, Alfa Laval’s diversified applications across the energy, food &amp; water, and marine sectors imply a vast market presence.39 The company is actively positioning itself in emerging high-growth areas, with hydrogen and carbon dioxide identified as important future markets for gas liquefaction.24 This strategic focus on nascent, high-potential markets indicates a forward-looking approach to capturing future growth.</p>

<p><strong>Customer Base:</strong> Alfa Laval serves a diverse global customer base spanning a wide array of industrial sectors.39 This diversification helps mitigate concentration risk and provides exposure to various economic cycles.</p>

<p>The company’s proactive alignment with global sustainability trends is a significant factor in its future growth trajectory. Alfa Laval’s emphasis on developing and selling sustainability solutions, coupled with its internal progress in this area, positions it to capitalize on the growing demand for energy-efficient and environmentally friendly industrial technologies. The strategic focus and R&amp;D investments in emerging markets like hydrogen and carbon dioxide are expected to unlock substantial new revenue streams, potentially offsetting cyclical weaknesses in more traditional industrial segments. This strategic foresight enables Alfa Laval to pursue long-term structural growth, regardless of short-term market fluctuations.</p>

<h5 id="4-competitive-landscape"><strong>4. Competitive Landscape</strong></h5>

<p>Alfa Laval operates within a competitive industrial landscape, but its established market position and strong performance metrics distinguish it among its peers.</p>

<p><strong>Main Competitors:</strong> The competitive environment for Alfa Laval includes both direct industrial machinery manufacturers and broader industrial conglomerates. Key competitors identified include Sandvik, Indutrade, Trelleborg, and AB SKF.39 In a broader context, large industrial players such as Siemens AG, Eaton Corp, GE Vernova, Parker Hannifin, Illinois Tool Works, Emerson Electric, Cummins, AMETEK, Otis Worldwide, and Rockwell Automation also operate in overlapping industrial segments.38</p>

<p><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> When benchmarked against its peers, Alfa Laval’s valuation metrics show a mixed picture. Its normalized Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 20.90 is higher than some competitors like WRT1V (18.75) but lower than others such as G1A (21.42).16 Simply Wall St suggests that Alfa Laval is currently trading at a good value compared to its peers and the broader industry.39 More importantly, Alfa Laval’s profitability metrics, including Return on Equity (ROE) of 19.19%, Return on Assets (ROA) of 9.00%, and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 14.30%, are strong within its industry comparable group.38</p>

<p>The presence of both specialized industrial machinery companies and large diversified conglomerates as competitors indicates a fragmented but intense market. Alfa Laval’s ability to maintain robust profitability margins and superior capital efficiency ratios (ROE, ROA, ROIC) relative to these diverse competitors highlights its operational efficiency and the strength of its competitive advantages. This strong relative performance suggests that Alfa Laval is well-positioned to defend its market share and maintain its pricing power, which are critical factors for sustained profitability and long-term value creation in a competitive environment.</p>

<h5 id="5-contracts-strategic-alliances--geopolitical-factors"><strong>5. Contracts, Strategic Alliances &amp; Geopolitical Factors</strong></h5>

<p>Alfa Laval’s strategic growth is partly driven by targeted acquisitions, though the company remains exposed to global macroeconomic and geopolitical influences, particularly currency fluctuations.</p>

<p><strong>Significant Government &amp; Commercial Contracts / Strategic Partnerships:</strong> A notable strategic move in the recent period was the acquisition of FIB Cryogenics for €800 million.24 This acquisition is strategically important as it expands Alfa Laval’s presence in the critical future markets of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, particularly for gas liquefaction applications.24 The acquisition is anticipated to be “somewhat accretive to the Group” in terms of margin 24, indicating a positive financial contribution.</p>

<p><strong>Geopolitical Exposure:</strong> As a global company, Alfa Laval is exposed to geopolitical factors and currency volatility. The Q1 2025 earnings report highlighted a “substantial impact” on order intake from a negative currency effect of approximately SEK 0.9 billion due to order book revaluation.18 This demonstrates how exchange rate fluctuations can directly affect reported financial performance. Management has indicated a commitment to continued investment in capacity and technology for FIB, suggesting a long-term view despite short-term currency headwinds.24</p>

<p>The acquisition of FIB Cryogenics represents a clear strategic initiative to position Alfa Laval in high-growth, future-oriented markets like hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This proactive mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity serves as a significant growth catalyst. However, the negative currency impact on the order book underscores that geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, particularly currency volatility, remain a persistent challenge for this global enterprise. While strategic acquisitions are expected to drive long-term growth, investors should closely monitor currency trends, as they can materially influence reported results. The company’s ability to mitigate these impacts through operational efficiency and strategic pricing will be crucial for sustained performance.</p>

<h5 id="6-future-strategy--growth-catalysts"><strong>6. Future Strategy &amp; Growth Catalysts</strong></h5>

<p>Alfa Laval’s future strategy is focused on strengthening its core business and leveraging key growth catalysts to drive sustained profitable expansion.</p>

<p><strong>Management’s Stated Strategy:</strong> The primary ambition of Alfa Laval’s management is to continuously strengthen the company, ensuring it is “well positioned for 2025” and beyond.23 This involves a commitment to ongoing investment in both capacity and technology.24</p>

<p><strong>Identifiable Growth Catalysts:</strong> Several factors are expected to drive Alfa Laval’s future growth:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Execution of Order Book:</strong> The company benefits from a substantial existing order book, which provided “solid invoicing” and “positive margin development” through its execution in Q1 2025.24 Specifically, a “massive order book in cargo pumping” extends coverage through 2025, 2026, and even beyond 24, providing significant revenue visibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Service and Transactional Business Growth:</strong> Alfa Laval continues to experience “strong growth in the transactional business and service” segments.24 This recurring revenue stream often provides stability and higher margins.</li>
  <li><strong>Strategic Acquisitions:</strong> The acquisition of FIB Cryogenics is a key growth catalyst, targeting the burgeoning hydrogen and carbon dioxide markets.24 This acquisition is expected to be “somewhat accretive to the Group” in terms of margin, indicating its potential to enhance overall profitability.24</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous Product Development and Technological Investment:</strong> Ongoing investment in capacity and technology is crucial for developing new solutions and maintaining a competitive edge.24</li>
  <li><strong>Alignment with Sustainability Trends:</strong> Alfa Laval views the development and sale of sustainability solutions as a core part of its business, with rewarding progress made in 2024.23 The company aims to make industries “smarter, more competitive, and more energy-efficient,” contributing to a more sustainable society.43 This focus positions them to capitalize on increasing global demand for environmentally friendly industrial solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alfa Laval’s strategy is characterized by a proactive approach to growth, not merely relying on a general economic recovery. The company is actively shaping its future through targeted investments and operational improvements. The substantial order backlog provides a clear runway for revenue generation in the near to medium term. Furthermore, the consistent growth in service and transactional business offers a stable foundation. Strategic acquisitions like FIB Cryogenics enable the company to tap into future high-growth markets, such as hydrogen and CO2, suggesting significant operational leverage and cross-selling opportunities. This multi-faceted growth strategy, rooted in innovation and sustainability, positions Alfa Laval for sustained revenue and earnings growth, even if the broader industrial market remains subdued.</p>

<h5 id="7-risk-assessment"><strong>7. Risk Assessment</strong></h5>

<p>Alfa Laval operates in a global industrial environment that presents various risks, but the company demonstrates a proactive approach to mitigation through operational and financial strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Key Company-Specific Risks:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Operational Risks:</strong> In 2024, the company’s global parts distribution system had “outgrown our capacity” 23, indicating a potential bottleneck in service delivery.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Risks:</strong> The company is exposed to currency fluctuations, which resulted in a “negative currency effect” of SEK 0.9 billion on the order book in Q1 2025.18</li>
  <li><strong>Safety Risks:</strong> While safety is a concern in industrial operations, Alfa Laval reported achieving its target Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) of 1.8 in 2024 23, indicating effective safety management.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Industry-Specific Risks:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The HVAC application market faced challenges in 2024 due to “exceptional low demand for heat pumps and a slow construction market in general”.23 This highlights sensitivity to specific sector downturns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mitigation Strategies:</p>

<p>Alfa Laval has implemented several strategies to address identified risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Operational Improvements:</strong> To counter the capacity issues in parts distribution, new distribution centers are under development.23</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous Investment:</strong> The company continues to invest in capacity and technology, which helps to build resilience and adapt to changing market conditions.24</li>
  <li><strong>Safety Programs:</strong> A dedicated “safety at work program” is in place to reduce accident frequency.23</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Resilience:</strong> The company’s net debt to EBITDA ratio significantly improved to 0.34 in Q1 2025 from 0.80 in Q1 2024 18, demonstrating strong financial health that can absorb external shocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alfa Laval’s approach to risk management appears robust and proactive. While it acknowledges market headwinds and currency impacts, its internal focus on operational improvements, such as expanding distribution capabilities and maintaining strong safety programs, combined with strategic pricing, suggests a strong ability to mitigate these challenges. The improvement in its net debt to EBITDA ratio further strengthens its financial resilience against external shocks. This comprehensive risk management framework enhances confidence in the company’s ability to execute its growth strategy despite the prevailing external uncertainties.</p>

<h5 id="8-analyst-sentiment--institutional-view"><strong>8. Analyst Sentiment &amp; Institutional View</strong></h5>

<p>Analyst sentiment towards Alfa Laval is generally positive, suggesting confidence in the company’s performance, although institutional ownership appears to be relatively low.</p>

<p><strong>Consensus Analyst Ratings:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Zacks Investment Research assigns a “Strong Buy” rating to Alfa Laval.41</li>
  <li>TipRanks reports a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating from analysts.40</li>
  <li>Morningstar indicates the stock is “Fairly Valued” 38 with “Medium” uncertainty.16</li>
  <li>Alpha Spread estimates the stock as 1% undervalued based on its DCF model.28</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Average Price Target &amp; Upside Potential:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The average price target from 10 analysts is SEK 444.90, which implies a 6.02% upside potential from the current price.40</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Recent Analyst Commentary Highlights:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Nasdaq notes that Alfa Laval is outperforming its peers in the Construction sector and the Engineering - R&amp;D Services industry on a year-to-date basis.41 The consensus EPS estimate for the full year has also moved 8.4% higher in the past quarter.41</li>
  <li>InvestingPro highlighted that while Q1 revenue increased significantly, EPS missed analysts’ forecasts by SEK 0.11, leading to a modest 1.1% decrease in the stock price following the earnings announcement.24</li>
  <li>Simply Wall St indicates that analysts have published new forecasts following the Q1 results.39</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Institutional Ownership:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Institutional ownership in Alfa Laval is reported as very low, less than 0.01%.40</li>
</ul>

<p>The combination of generally positive analyst sentiment and an estimated upside potential, contrasted with very low institutional ownership, presents an interesting dynamic. While analysts appear to see fundamental value and growth potential in Alfa Laval, major institutions may not yet be heavily invested. This could indicate a lack of broader market awareness of the company’s strengths or a “wait-and-see” approach from large funds, perhaps due to recent stock performance or other factors. If the company continues to execute its strategy and market conditions improve, there could be significant upside potential as institutional interest and investment grow.</p>

<h5 id="9-management--governance"><strong>9. Management &amp; Governance</strong></h5>

<p>Alfa Laval’s management and governance structure emphasize ethical conduct, operational excellence, and sustainability, contributing to a stable and responsible corporate environment.</p>

<p>Management Team Assessment:</p>

<p>The Group Management team holds the responsibility for implementing the company’s Business Principles, including the establishment and review of improvement targets.44 This team actively participates in key councils that develop policies, processes, and monitor progress in specific areas, suchating the Commercial Ethics Council (which covers Anti-Bribery &amp; Corruption and Export Control), the Health and Safety Council, and the Environmental Council.44 The CEO of Alfa Laval is Tom Erixon.39 This structure indicates a commitment to integrating ethical, safety, and environmental considerations directly into the core management functions.</p>

<p>Corporate Governance Standards:</p>

<p>Alfa Laval’s corporate governance is supported by an independent internal audit function. This function plays a crucial role in monitoring compliance with the company’s Business Principles, ensuring adherence to internal policies and external regulations.44 This oversight mechanism reinforces accountability and transparency within the organization.</p>

<p>The direct involvement of the Group Management in councils dedicated to commercial ethics, health and safety, and environmental stewardship demonstrates a strong commitment to ethical conduct, employee well-being, and environmental responsibility at the highest levels of the company. This integration of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors into core management functions and the presence of an independent audit function for compliance are positive indicators of robust corporate governance. Strong corporate governance and a clear focus on sustainability can mitigate potential reputational and regulatory risks, which in turn can lead to more stable long-term performance and attract a broader base of responsible investors.</p>

<h5 id="10-current-market-sentiment--technical-analysis-briefly-for-selected-stocks"><strong>10. Current Market Sentiment &amp; Technical Analysis (Briefly for selected stocks)</strong></h5>

<p>Current market sentiment towards Alfa Laval is mixed, reflecting both recent positive financial performance and broader market dynamics, while technical indicators suggest a balanced but potentially consolidating price action.</p>

<p>News Flow &amp; Sentiment:</p>

<p>Recent news flow includes positive updates on Q1 2025 results and a proposed dividend increase.39 However, there was also news of a slight stock price decrease following an EPS miss, indicating some investor disappointment despite overall revenue growth.24 This suggests a nuanced sentiment, where strong operational performance is balanced against high market expectations.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Indicators:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Price Performance:</strong> The stock price has moved approximately 1.8% on a year-to-date basis, notably outperforming the broader Construction sector, which returned an average of -2.2% over the same period.41</li>
  <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> The weekly volatility of the stock has remained stable at 4% over the past year 39, suggesting a relatively predictable price movement without extreme swings.</li>
  <li><strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI):</strong> The RSI is currently at 58.15.40 An RSI between 30 and 70 is generally considered neutral, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.</li>
  <li><strong>Moving Averages:</strong> The 50-day moving average price is SEK 411.99, while the 200-day moving average price is SEK 447.62.40 The current reference price of SEK 408.90 15 is below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend within a longer-term negative trend.</li>
</ul>

<p>The technical analysis indicates a period of consolidation or a potential bottoming process for Alfa Laval. While the stock has shown relative strength compared to its sector year-to-date, its current position below key moving averages suggests that it has not yet confirmed a strong upward momentum. The stable volatility and neutral RSI indicate a lack of extreme technical signals. This combination implies that the current price may represent an attractive entry point for long-term investors, particularly if there is a confirmation of a reversal or a break above the 200-day moving average.</p>

The launch of the Manufacturing Footprint Program (MFP) is a proactive measure aimed at realizing significant cost savings by 2026, which is expected to improve profitability and mitigate external pressures. The company’s continued organic growth, particularly in key divisions like Global Technologies and Americas, further demonstrates its ability to expand even in a difficult macroeconomic climate. This strategic focus on cost management and portfolio optimization positions Assa Abloy for improved profitability and resilience in the face of ongoing market challenges.</p>

<h5 id="2-business-model--competitive-moat-1"><strong>2. Business Model &amp; Competitive Moat</strong></h5>

<p>Assa Abloy’s business model is characterized by its global leadership in access solutions, underpinned by a robust competitive moat derived from continuous innovation, extensive market presence, and a strong brand portfolio.</p>

  <li><strong>Strong Global Brands:</strong> Its portfolio includes over 200 global, regional, and local brands, such as Yale, Kwikset, and HID, which foster trust, loyalty, and brand differentiation.27</li>
  <li><strong>Robust R&amp;D and Patent Portfolio:</strong> Continuous high investment in R&amp;D and a prolific patenting activity create proprietary technologies that are difficult for new entrants to replicate.27</li>
  <li><strong>High Switching Costs:</strong> For commercial and institutional customers, replacing established access control systems involves significant costs and operational disruption, creating high switching barriers.</li>
  <li><strong>Global Distribution and Customer Relationships:</strong> Long-standing relationships with an extensive global and local network of distributors and sales partners ensure efficient market penetration.27</li>
</ul>

<p>Assa Abloy’s status as a “global titan” is firmly established by its vast installed base, deep industry expertise, and powerful brand portfolio, which collectively create substantial barriers to entry. The company’s commitment to continuous innovation, as evidenced by its prolific product launches and significant R&amp;D investments, demonstrates its proactive approach to evolving its product offerings, particularly towards electromechanical and digital solutions. This strategic foresight ensures that Assa Abloy not only defends its existing market share but also actively captures new growth opportunities in the dynamic security landscape.

The company’s strategic focus on the transition to digital solutions suggests significant growth potential as these technologies gain broader adoption across various end-user segments.</p>

<p><strong>Customer Base:</strong> The company serves a highly diversified customer base, ranging from large commercial enterprises and government entities to individual residential consumers.47 This diversification helps to mitigate customer concentration risk and provides exposure to different market cycles and demand drivers.</p>

<p>The industry’s accelerating shift towards digitalization and smart security systems represents a significant tailwind for Assa Abloy. The company’s strong organic sales growth in its Global Technologies division, which achieved an impressive 8% in Q1 2025 20, directly reflects its success in capturing demand for these advanced solutions. This strategic alignment with the broader digitalization and smartification trends within the security industry positions Assa Abloy for sustained structural growth. As the demand for integrated and intelligent access solutions continues to increase globally, the company is well-prepared to expand its market presence and enhance its profitability.</p>

<h5 id="4-competitive-landscape-1"><strong>4. Competitive Landscape</strong></h5>

<p>Assa Abloy operates within a competitive global market for access solutions, but its established market leadership and superior performance metrics justify its valuation relative to peers.</p>

<p><strong>Main Competitors:</strong> Assa Abloy faces competition from a range of companies, including direct industrial peers and broader building product manufacturers. Key competitors include Johnson Controls International (JCI) and Allegion PLC (ALLE).47 Other competitors in the broader building and security industry include Belimo Holding, dormakaba Holding, Geberit, and Forbo Holding.51 Securitas AB is also identified as a competitor, particularly in commercial services.47</p>

<p><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> When benchmarked against its competitors, Assa Abloy’s valuation and profitability metrics present a compelling picture. Its Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 23x is lower than some direct peers like Belimo (67.3x) and dormakaba (45.5x).51 While this P/E is slightly higher than the European Building industry average of 21.5x, it is considered reasonable given the company’s strong market position.51 More importantly, Assa Abloy’s profitability metrics, including Return on Assets (ROA) of 6.78%, Return on Equity (ROE) of 14.33%, and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 9.87%, are generally strong compared to its identified peers.47</p>

<p>The company’s ability to command a premium valuation relative to the broader industry, while still appearing comparatively attractive against some direct competitors, suggests that the market recognizes and rewards its superior competitive position and consistent operational performance. This indicates that Assa Abloy’s established market leadership and robust profitability metrics justify its current valuation. The company’s consistent execution and strong competitive advantages are key factors enabling it to maintain this market standing.</p>

<h5 id="5-contracts-strategic-alliances--geopolitical-factors-1"><strong>5. Contracts, Strategic Alliances &amp; Geopolitical Factors</strong></h5>

<p>Assa Abloy actively manages its portfolio through strategic transactions and demonstrates resilience in navigating geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds.</p>

<p><strong>Significant Government &amp; Commercial Contracts / Strategic Partnerships:</strong> The company actively pursues growth through mergers and acquisitions. In Q1 2025, Assa Abloy completed six acquisitions with a combined annual sales value of approximately SEK 3.6 billion.19 Concurrently, the divestment of the majority of Citizen ID was completed 19, indicating a strategic focus on optimizing its business portfolio.</p>

<p><strong>Geopolitical Exposure:</strong> The macroeconomic environment remains challenging, marked by ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and high interest rates.19 These factors have had tangible impacts on the company’s operations; for instance, Q1 2025 cash flow was affected by an inventory build-up undertaken in preparation for anticipated tariffs.19 Assa Abloy has also stated its intention to raise prices if the US implements tariffs on Canada and Mexico 56, demonstrating a proactive approach to mitigating cost pressures from trade conflicts. The company’s management emphasizes that its “resilient business model” and “local presence” help to limit exposure to shifts in the global trade landscape and macro volatility.49</p>

<p>Assa Abloy’s strategy involves dynamic portfolio management through targeted acquisitions and divestments, which are designed to optimize its business mix. While the company is exposed to geopolitical uncertainty and trade tariffs, as evidenced by the impact on its Q1 cash flow, it has demonstrated a capacity to adapt. The ability to pass on tariff-related costs through price increases highlights its pricing power, which is a crucial competitive advantage in a protectionist environment. The company’s emphasis on a local-for-local approach, implied by its “local presence” strategy, further contributes to its resilience against global trade disruptions. This proactive management of external factors enhances its ability to maintain stability and execute its strategy.</p>

<h5 id="6-future-strategy--growth-catalysts-1"><strong>6. Future Strategy &amp; Growth Catalysts</strong></h5>

<h5 id="7-risk-assessment-1"><strong>7. Risk Assessment</strong></h5>

<p>Assa Abloy operates within a dynamic global environment, exposing it to various risks, but the company demonstrates a robust and proactive approach to risk management.</p>

<p><strong>Key Company-Specific Risks:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Operational Risks:</strong> The company is undergoing a restructuring process, including the Manufacturing Footprint Program (MFP), which entails associated restructuring costs.19 Additionally, Q1 2025 cash flow was impacted by an inventory build-up in anticipation of tariffs.19</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Risks:</strong> Assa Abloy is exposed to currency risk, which can affect the translation of foreign earnings and the cost of cross-border trade.27 Costs related to acquisitions and divestments can also temporarily dilute margins.19</li>
  <li><strong>Compliance and Reputational Risks:</strong> The company faces risks related to corrupt activities, violations of competition law, and breaches of data protection regulations.58 Failure to adhere to ethical standards can damage its reputation.27</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Industry-Specific Risks:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The industry is subject to macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and trade barriers, including protectionist measures.59</li>
  <li>Price fluctuations and the availability of raw materials, such as steel, pose a risk to production costs.27</li>
</ul>

<p>Mitigation Strategies:</p>

<p>Assa Abloy has implemented comprehensive strategies to address these risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cost Management and Operational Efficiency:</strong> The MFP is designed to generate significant cost savings and improve overall manufacturing efficiency.19 The company also employs strong operating leverage from price realization and cost management to offset pressures.19</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Resilience:</strong> A robust balance sheet, indicated by a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.2x 20, provides financial flexibility to absorb shocks. The ability to pass on tariff costs through price increases demonstrates pricing power.56</li>
  <li><strong>Ethical Conduct and Compliance:</strong> A detailed Code of Conduct guides employees and business partners, addressing compliance and reputational risks related to bribery, competition, and data protection.58</li>
  <li><strong>Geopolitical Adaptation:</strong> The company’s resilient business model and local presence are cited as factors that limit exposure to shifts in the global trade landscape.49 Proactive portfolio management through acquisitions and divestments also helps optimize the business mix.19</li>
</ul>

<p>Assa Abloy’s comprehensive approach to risk management, which includes proactive cost control, strategic financial positioning, and adherence to high ethical standards, suggests it is well-equipped to navigate a complex and uncertain global environment. This robust framework enhances the company’s stability and its ability to execute its strategic objectives despite external challenges.</p>

<h5 id="10-current-market-sentiment--technical-analysis-briefly-for-selected-stocks-1"><strong>10. Current Market Sentiment &amp; Technical Analysis (Briefly for selected stocks)</strong></h5>

<p>Current market sentiment towards Assa Abloy is largely positive, supported by recent financial performance and analyst upgrades, which is also reflected in its technical indicators.</p>

<p>News Flow &amp; Sentiment:</p>

<p>Recent news flow has been positive, highlighting strong Q1 2025 results, analyst upgrades, and dividend announcements.54 However, there are also ongoing discussions about the impact of tariffs, which the company is proactively addressing through potential price increases.56 The overall sentiment appears to be one of confidence in the company’s ability to navigate macroeconomic challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Indicators:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Price Performance:</strong> The stock price surged by 5.09% intraday on May 12, 2025, reaching its highest level since January 2025. This marked a fourth consecutive day of gains, with a total increase of 8.25% over four days.54 Over the past two weeks, the price has risen by 4.77%.62</li>
  <li><strong>Current Price:</strong> As of May 21, 2025, the current reference price for ASSA B is SEK 312.40.13</li>
  <li><strong>Moving Averages:</strong> The 50-day moving average is SEK 308.50, and the 200-day moving average is SEK 302.50.13 The current price is above both these key moving averages, indicating a short-term and medium-term bullish trend.</li>
  <li><strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI):</strong> Not explicitly provided in recent snippets, but generally, a strong price trend would push the RSI higher.</li>
</ul>

<p>The recent surge in Assa Abloy’s stock price and its sustained gains indicate strong positive market sentiment. This technical strength appears to be fundamentally driven by the robust Q1 2025 results, positive analyst upgrades (such as BNP Paribas’s “Strong Buy” rating) 54, and consistent dividend announcements. The positive guidance from other companies in the sector, like BorgWarner, may also be contributing to broader industry tailwinds.54 This alignment between strong fundamentals and positive technicals suggests potential for continued upward momentum. However, investors should remain vigilant for signs of overextension after the recent rally.</p>

<h5 id="1-financial-health--performance-2"><strong>1. Financial Health &amp; Performance</strong></h5>

</ul>

<p>Balance Sheet Strength:</p>

<p>Evolution maintains a very strong balance sheet, characterized by a debt-free position and high liquidity.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> The company is effectively debt-free, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.02.31</li>
  <li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> The current ratio is a healthy 1.81.21</li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>P/E (Normalized):</strong> The normalized P/E is 10.28 21, with a current P/E of 9.59.15</li>
  <li><strong>P/S:</strong> The current P/S is 0.62.15</li>
  <li><strong>P/B:</strong> The current P/B is 2.18.15</li>

</ul>

<p>Most Recent Earnings Report (Q1 2025):</p>

<p>The Q1 2025 earnings report indicated a deceleration in revenue growth and a slight dip in EBITDA margin. Net revenues increased by 3.9% to EUR 520.9 million (6.1% at constant currency), but EBITDA decreased by 1.1% to EUR 342.0 million, resulting in a 65.6% margin.63 EPS was €1.24.63 Management attributed this slowdown to “conscious actions” taken for longer-term business benefits and currency effects.63 Live Casino revenue grew by 4%, and RNG revenue showed steady improvements.32 Management reiterated its full-year EBITDA margin estimate of 66-68%, expecting Q2 to also be impacted but a stronger performance in H2 2025.63 Analysts generally maintain a positive outlook, with Simply Wall St noting “good agreement” for a 26.8% stock price increase.70 Alpha Spread shows an average 1-year price target of SEK 1,060.9, implying a 65% upside.71</p>

<p>The Q1 2025 slowdown in revenue growth and slight margin contraction are presented by management as temporary effects of strategic adjustments aimed at long-term benefits. The reiterated full-year EBITDA margin guidance signals strong confidence in a recovery during the latter half of 2025. This suggests that the Q1 performance should be viewed as a tactical maneuver rather than a fundamental deterioration of the business.</p>

<h5 id="2-business-model--competitive-moat-2"><strong>2. Business Model &amp; Competitive Moat</strong></h5>

<p>Evolution AB’s business model is built on providing B2B online casino solutions, fortified by a robust competitive moat derived from its technological leadership, operational excellence, and strategic positioning in a highly regulated industry.</p>

<p><strong>Core Business Model:</strong> Evolution innovates, develops, and produces online casino content, including live casino and Random Number Generated (RNG) games, for gaming operators on a business-to-business (B2B) basis.21 Revenue is primarily generated through commission fees, calculated as a percentage of operators’ winnings from Evolution’s offerings, along with monthly fees for dedicated, customizable tables.21 The company’s “One Stop Shop” (OSS) solution simplifies integration for operators, enhancing efficiency.21</p>

<p><strong>Technological Advantages &amp; Innovation:</strong> Evolution maintains a significant technological edge. It pioneered in-house developed game shows in 2017, which have become a key attraction for new player demographics.21 The company continuously develops new game variants and unique twists on traditional table games, and actively expands its game show portfolio using advanced technology.21 Its proprietary video coding solution ensures continuous HD video streaming, and its systems boast high availability (99.96% in 2024).21 Recent innovations include “Bet with Streamers” and “AI Slot Recommender” features on its OSS interface.32</p>

<p><strong>Competitive Positioning &amp; Market Share:</strong> Evolution holds a clear leadership position in the online casino market and aims to continuously increase its lead over competitors.21</p>

<p><strong>Barriers to Entry:</strong> Evolution’s competitive moat is substantial, built on several key factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Product Innovation:</strong> Its continuous introduction of high-entertainment value games, particularly its unique game shows, differentiates it from competitors.21</li>
  <li><strong>Proprietary Technology and Infrastructure:</strong> The OSS solution, in-house video coding, and global network of 21 studios across Europe, North America, and South America create a formidable technological barrier.21</li>
  <li><strong>Operational Excellence and Security:</strong> The Mission Control Room (MCR) provides 24/7 real-time monitoring, advanced video recognition, and ISO 27001:2022 IT security certification, ensuring game integrity and preventing fraud.21</li>
  <li><strong>In-house Manufacturing (Job Shop):</strong> Its Job Shop in Riga allows for rapid prototyping and production of specialized game devices, shortening time-to-market and ensuring quality control.21</li>
  <li><strong>Regulatory Complexity:</strong> The highly regulated nature of the gaming industry, with varying national licensing requirements, acts as a significant barrier for new entrants, favoring established players with the resources and expertise to navigate these complexities.21</li>
</ul>

<p>Evolution’s business model is inherently protected by its technological superiority and operational scale. Its clear market leadership is sustained by continuous innovation, which includes unique game formats and AI-powered tools, and a robust, secure global infrastructure. The stringent regulatory environment of the gaming industry further strengthens this competitive advantage, as it creates significant barriers to entry for new players. This combination of a strong competitive moat and the ongoing digitalization of the gaming industry positions Evolution for sustained market share gains and continued high profitability as more markets regulate online gambling.</p>

<h5 id="3-market--industry-dynamics-2"><strong>3. Market &amp; Industry Dynamics</strong></h5>

<p>Evolution AB is strategically positioned to benefit from significant market and industry dynamics, particularly the structural shift towards online gaming and the expansion of regulated markets globally.</p>

<p><strong>Industry Trends:</strong> The gaming industry is experiencing a profound structural transformation, with a growing number of players transitioning from traditional land-based casinos to online platforms.21 This trend is driving increased demand for high-quality online casino content. A key aspect of this dynamic is the increasing number of jurisdictions that are introducing national regulations for online gambling, which creates a more structured and legitimate market for providers.21</p>

<p><strong>Market Size &amp; Growth Potential:</strong> While specific total addressable market (TAM) figures are not explicitly quantified in the provided information, Evolution’s active expansion into new US states (e.g., Delaware, Pennsylvania, Michigan) and emerging markets like Brazil and the Philippines indicates significant untapped growth potential.21 The company’s goal to grow faster than the global online casino market underscores its ambition to capture a larger share of this expanding industry.21</p>

<p><strong>Customer Base:</strong> Evolution primarily serves the majority of large online gaming operators in Europe and North America, and is also expanding its partnerships with land-based casinos that are transitioning to online offerings.21 However, the company’s reliance on a concentrated customer base is a factor to monitor, as its top five customers accounted for 46% of its net revenue in 2024.21</p>

<p>The increasing number of states and countries that are regulating online gambling is a crucial long-term growth driver for Evolution. This regulatory expansion provides a clear and sustainable runway for growth, as it establishes clear rules for operators and creates a more legitimate market for providers like Evolution. As more jurisdictions regulate, Evolution is well-positioned to expand its addressable market and deepen its relationships with operators who seek compliant and high-quality solutions. This structural tailwind from global regulatory expansion is expected to fuel sustained revenue growth for the company.</p>

<h5 id="4-competitive-landscape-2"><strong>4. Competitive Landscape</strong></h5>

<p>Evolution AB operates within a competitive yet fragmented market, where its strong market position and compelling valuation metrics differentiate it from its peers.</p>

<p><strong>Main Competitors:</strong> Evolution faces competition from various players in the broader gaming and software sectors. Identified competitors include Embracer Group, Sinch AB, Kambi Group plc, Kindred Group plc, and Samhällsbyggnadsbolaget i Norden AB.21 These companies represent a mix of gaming operators, software providers, and other diversified entities.</p>

<p><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> When benchmarked against its direct peers in the gaming industry, Evolution’s valuation appears particularly attractive. Its Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.28 is notably lower than that of Kambi Group plc (20.59) and Kindred Group plc (32.30).21 This suggests that Evolution may be undervalued relative to its direct competitors in the online gaming sector. Simply Wall St further supports this view, estimating Evolution as trading 49.7% below its estimated fair value 68, while Alpha Spread estimates it as 45% 65 to 52% 69 undervalued based on its Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.</p>

<p>This relative undervaluation, particularly when compared to its direct peers in the gaming industry, presents a significant investment opportunity. Despite its strong profitability and clear market leadership, the market may not be fully appreciating Evolution’s growth potential or the strength of its competitive advantages. This discrepancy suggests that the company’s robust fundamentals and strong growth catalysts may not be fully priced into its current market valuation.</p>

<h5 id="5-contracts-strategic-alliances--geopolitical-factors-2"><strong>5. Contracts, Strategic Alliances &amp; Geopolitical Factors</strong></h5>

<p>Evolution AB actively pursues growth through strategic partnerships and acquisitions, but its global operations expose it to various geopolitical and operational risks, including cyber threats.</p>

<p><strong>Significant Government &amp; Commercial Contracts / Strategic Partnerships:</strong> Evolution is expanding its market reach and product offerings through key collaborations and acquisitions. The company has deepened its partnerships with major operators in North America.32 Recent strategic acquisitions include Livespins, a B2B social streaming game provider, and Galaxy Gaming, a developer of casino table games and enhanced gaming technology.21 These acquisitions are intended to extend Evolution’s offerings and market presence. Additionally, the company successfully launched live dealer games on bet365 Casino in New Jersey 67, demonstrating its ability to secure and execute significant commercial contracts.</p>

<p><strong>Geopolitical Exposure:</strong> Evolution’s global operational footprint exposes it to geopolitical risks. The company experienced disruptions at its Georgia studio due to “external sabotage” and faced “cyber-attacks targeting its Asian operations” in the second half of 2024.31 These incidents highlight the vulnerability of its operations to external threats. The company also acknowledges that geopolitical factors and trade barriers can impact its operations.63</p>

<p>While Evolution is actively expanding its market presence and product portfolio through strategic partnerships and acquisitions, it has also faced direct operational challenges from external sabotage and cyber-attacks. These incidents underscore the inherent operational and cybersecurity risks associated with a highly digital and globally distributed business. However, the company’s ability to respond swiftly with “contingency” measures 32 and maintain its full-year guidance 63 despite these disruptions demonstrates its resilience. Investors should continue to monitor the effectiveness of Evolution’s security measures and its operational robustness, as these factors are critical for sustained performance in a dynamic and interconnected global environment.</p>

<h5 id="6-future-strategy--growth-catalysts-2"><strong>6. Future Strategy &amp; Growth Catalysts</strong></h5>

<p>Evolution AB’s future strategy is characterized by aggressive product and geographic expansion, aiming to solidify its market leadership and drive long-term growth.</p>

<p><strong>Management’s Stated Strategy:</strong> Evolution’s primary focus for 2025 and beyond is on continued growth and market share expansion.21 The company plans to achieve this through ongoing investment in new studios, game development, and technology-driven innovations, with the aim of increasing its lead over competitors.21 Management has reiterated its full-year EBITDA margin estimate of 66-68%, expecting a stronger second half of 2025 to compensate for any short-term impacts.63</p>

<p><strong>Identifiable Growth Catalysts:</strong> Several factors are expected to fuel Evolution’s future growth:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Product Innovation (“Product Leap” Initiative):</strong> The company is committed to continuous product innovation. In 2024, it launched over 100 new games 32, including popular game shows like Lightning Storm and Lightning Dragon Tiger, and new game types such as Balloon Race.32 Future plans include “Speed Game Shows” to cater to demand for fast-paced content.21 The rollout of new features like “Bet with Streamers” and “AI Slot Recommender” on its OSS interface further enhances its offering.32</li>
  <li><strong>Geographic Expansion:</strong> Evolution is actively expanding its presence in new markets. This includes continued growth in the US, with new studio projects in Brazil and the Philippines.21 The company is also entering new US states, such as Delaware, and launching popular games like Crazy Time in Pennsylvania and Michigan.21 Europe is expected to continue its steady growth, and Latin America is anticipated to see significant development following Brazil’s new regulatory framework.21</li>
  <li><strong>RNG Segment Momentum:</strong> The Random Number Generated (RNG) segment is showing steady improvements and increasing momentum heading into 2025 32, indicating a diversified growth engine beyond live casino.</li>
  <li><strong>Strategic Acquisitions:</strong> Recent acquisitions like Livespins (B2B social streaming) and Galaxy Gaming (casino table games) are expected to extend Evolution’s offerings and market reach.21</li>
  <li><strong>Share Buyback Program:</strong> A share buyback program of up to €500 million is planned for 2025 31, signaling management’s confidence in future cash flows and commitment to shareholder returns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Evolution’s growth strategy is characterized by an aggressive and multi-pronged approach, focusing on both product innovation and geographic expansion. The “Product Leap” initiative, with its rapid introduction of new and engaging games, ensures the company’s continued relevance and appeal to a broad player base. Simultaneously, its expansion into new US states and emerging markets like Brazil and the Philippines allows it to tap into new regulated growth opportunities. This comprehensive strategy, supported by strong cash generation and a commitment to shareholder returns through buybacks, positions Evolution to capture a larger share of the expanding online casino market and deliver significant long-term returns.</p>

<h5 id="7-risk-assessment-2"><strong>7. Risk Assessment</strong></h5>

<p>Evolution AB operates in a dynamic and highly regulated industry, exposing it to specific risks, though the company demonstrates robust mitigation strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Key Company-Specific Risks:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Operational Risks:</strong> The company has experienced operational disruptions, including “external sabotage” at its Georgia studio and “cyber-attacks targeting its Asian operations” in H2 2024.31 These incidents highlight vulnerabilities in its global operational infrastructure.</li>
  <li><strong>Dependence on Key Personnel &amp; Customers:</strong> Evolution relies on key personnel and skilled employees, particularly those in operational roles at gaming tables.21 A high employee turnover or loss of key individuals could negatively impact the business. Furthermore, the company has a concentrated customer base, with its top five customers accounting for 46% of net revenue in 2024.21 This concentration poses a risk if a major customer’s business deteriorates or if they switch to a competitor.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal &amp; Compliance Risks:</strong> The gaming industry is highly regulated, with complex and often inconsistent laws across jurisdictions.21 Changes in regulations, unfavorable interpretations of existing laws, or the withdrawal/non-renewal of licenses could significantly impact operations. Risks also exist related to anti-money laundering, market abuse, data protection, and tax compliance.21</li>
  <li><strong>Reputational Risks:</strong> Incidents like external sabotage could lead to reputational damage.31</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Industry-Specific Risks:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intense Competition:</strong> The online gaming industry is highly competitive, with new providers entering the market and existing ones expanding their offerings.21</li>
  <li><strong>Geopolitical Factors:</strong> Geopolitical tensions and trade barriers can also impact operations.63</li>
</ul>

<p>Mitigation Strategies:</p>

<p>Evolution has implemented comprehensive strategies to address these risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Operational Robustness:</strong> The company responded swiftly to disruptions with “contingency” plans.32 Its Mission Control Room (MCR) provides 24/7 real-time monitoring and utilizes advanced video recognition technology for fraud detection and game integrity.21 The company holds ISO 27001:2022 certification for IT security.21</li>
  <li><strong>Diversified Infrastructure:</strong> Operating 21 studios globally helps to mitigate single-point-of-failure risks and supports compliance with national regulations requiring a physical presence.21</li>
  <li><strong>Compliance and Governance:</strong> Evolution adheres to the Swedish Corporate Governance Code and has established a Compliance Committee (since 2023) to review and enhance compliance processes.21</li>
  <li><strong>Product Research and Quality:</strong> A dedicated team focuses on player experience and market trends to ensure product quality and relevance.21</li>
</ul>

<p>While Evolution demonstrates strong operational controls and a robust compliance framework, its reliance on a concentrated customer base and the inherent regulatory scrutiny of the gaming industry represent key vulnerabilities. The recent incidents of external sabotage and cyber-attacks underscore the critical importance of maintaining sophisticated operational and cybersecurity defenses. Investors should closely monitor customer concentration and regulatory developments, as these factors can significantly influence the company’s performance, even for a leading player in this dynamic sector.</p>

<h5 id="8-analyst-sentiment--institutional-view-2"><strong>8. Analyst Sentiment &amp; Institutional View</strong></h5>

<h5 id="9-management--governance-2"><strong>9. Management &amp; Governance</strong></h5>

<p>Evolution AB’s management and governance framework are designed to support aggressive growth and operational integrity within a highly regulated industry.</p>

<p>Management Team Assessment:</p>

<p>Evolution’s Group Management team is composed of experienced professionals, including Martin Carlesund as Group CEO and Joakim Andersson as Chief Financial Officer (who started in February 2025).21 The team is recognized for its extensive experience in leadership roles.21 The Group CEO is appointed by the Board and is responsible for the ongoing administration of the Group.21 The Extended Group Management (EGM), comprising 17 senior executives, is responsible for pursuing sustainability matters and implementing targets in their respective areas.21</p>

<p>Corporate Governance Standards:</p>

<p>Evolution AB (publ) is a Swedish public limited company listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. Its corporate governance adheres to applicable statutes and regulations, including the Swedish Companies Act, the EU Market Abuse Regulation, and the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance.21</p>

<p>Key aspects of its governance structure include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Shareholders and General Meetings:</strong> The Annual General Meeting (AGM) serves as the highest decision-making body, where shareholders exert their influence.21</li>
  <li><strong>Board of Directors:</strong> The Board holds overall responsibility for the company’s organization and management, acting in the best interests of the company and all shareholders. Its duties include setting targets and strategies, evaluating the Group CEO, and ensuring robust control systems for operations, risks, and regulatory compliance.21 In 2024, the Board consisted of 6 members, with a strong emphasis on independence (83% independent of the company, 67% independent of major shareholders).21 The Board also has a diversity policy that aims for versatility, breadth of expertise, and gender equality.21</li>
  <li><strong>Board Committees:</strong> The Board operates through specialized committees, including a Remuneration Committee, an Audit Committee, and a Compliance Committee (established in 2023).21 The Compliance Committee is specifically tasked with reviewing and enhancing compliance processes and procedures.21</li>
  <li><strong>Internal Audit and Auditors:</strong> An internal audit function, established in 2020, reports to the Audit Committee and the Board, evaluating internal control and risk management.21 External auditors (Öhrlings PricewaterhouseCoopers AB) are elected annually by the AGM to examine the company’s reports and management.21</li>

</ul>

The Board’s strong oversight, including a dedicated Compliance Committee, demonstrates a commitment to navigating regulatory complexities while pursuing aggressive growth. This robust governance structure provides a stable and reliable foundation for the company’s ambitious expansion plans, mitigating potential risks associated with rapid growth and complex regulatory environments.</p>

<h5 id="10-current-market-sentiment--technical-analysis-briefly-for-selected-stocks-2"><strong>10. Current Market Sentiment &amp; Technical Analysis (Briefly for selected stocks)</strong></h5>

<p>Current market sentiment towards Evolution AB is generally positive, with technical indicators suggesting potential for continued upward movement, despite some recent volatility.</p>

<p>News Flow &amp; Sentiment:</p>

<p>Recent news flow includes positive updates on Q1 2025 results, dividend approvals, and new game launches.67 However, there was also news of a stock price fall and deteriorating investor sentiment on April 30, 2025.67 This indicates a mixed sentiment, where strong fundamental performance is occasionally met with market-driven volatility.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Indicators:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Current Price:</strong> As of May 23, 2025, the current reference price for EVO is SEK 642.40.15</li>
  <li><strong>Valuation:</strong> The stock is estimated to be significantly undervalued by its intrinsic value. Alpha Spread calculates a DCF value of SEK 1,356.83, indicating it is 52% undervalued compared to the current market price of SEK 647.8.69 Simply Wall St estimates it is trading 49.7% below its estimated fair value.68</li>
  <li><strong>P/E Ratio:</strong> The current P/E ratio is 9.59 15, which is notably lower than its 3-year (18.22), 5-year (30.41), and 10-year (33.00) historical averages.21 This suggests the stock is currently trading at a discount relative to its own historical valuation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The combination of a significantly undervalued stock based on intrinsic and historical P/E analysis, despite recent market volatility, suggests a compelling investment opportunity. The current price may represent an attractive entry point for long-term investors seeking a leader in a growing, regulated market, especially if the company delivers on its expectation for a stronger second half of 2025. The lower P/E relative to historical averages could indicate that the market has not yet fully priced in the company’s strong fundamentals and future growth potential.</p>

The strong analyst ratings and price targets further validate this positive outlook, suggesting a robust growth trajectory for the next 1-3 years and beyond.</p>

<h5 id="2-business-model--competitive-moat-3"><strong>2. Business Model &amp; Competitive Moat</strong></h5>

<p>AstraZeneca’s business model is characterized by its science-led approach to pharmaceuticals, underpinned by a wide competitive moat derived from extensive R&amp;D, a diversified portfolio, and strong intellectual property.</p>

<p><strong>Core Business Model:</strong> AstraZeneca operates as a global, science-led pharmaceutical company focused on the research, development, and commercialization of prescription medicines.22 Its revenue is generated from the sale of branded drugs across several major therapeutic areas, including Oncology (approximately 40% of total revenue), Cardiovascular, Renal, and Metabolic (25%), Rare Disease (17%), and Respiratory and Immunology (15%).77 The company has a global reach and a diversified portfolio, serving patients across primary care, specialty care, and rare diseases.22</p>

<p><strong>Technological Advantages &amp; Innovation:</strong> Innovation is central to AstraZeneca’s strategy. The company invests significantly in transformative new technologies and modalities to shape the future of medicine.81 Its R&amp;D approach emphasizes precision medicine, transformative science, data science &amp; AI, and clinical innovation.82 Key investment areas include antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), cell therapy, gene therapy, and next-generation immuno-oncology bispecifics.22 The company also focuses on weight management and risk factors, targeting underlying causes of obesity with novel treatments.22</p>

<p><strong>Competitive Positioning &amp; Market Share:</strong> AstraZeneca holds a leading position with diversified and well-established platforms.83 It aims to be a pioneer in science, a leader in its disease areas, and a transformer of patient outcomes.22 The company is actively leading a “revolution to redefine cancer care”.83</p>

<p><strong>Barriers to Entry:</strong> AstraZeneca’s competitive moat is wide due to several factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Extensive R&amp;D Capabilities and Pipeline:</strong> The high costs and risks associated with drug discovery and development, coupled with a robust pipeline (194 projects) 75, create substantial barriers.</li>
  <li><strong>Strong Patent Position:</strong> The company maintains an attractive patent position with low exposure to loss of exclusivity.83</li>
  <li><strong>Regulatory Hurdles:</strong> The stringent and lengthy regulatory approval processes for new drugs act as a significant barrier for potential competitors.75</li>
  <li><strong>Global Reach and Diversified Portfolio:</strong> Its presence across multiple therapeutic areas and geographies provides a broad base of operations and revenue streams, reducing reliance on single products or markets.22</li>
  <li><strong>Clinical Trial Execution Excellence:</strong> A strong track record in clinical trial execution ensures efficient progression of drug candidates.83</li>
</ul>

<p>AstraZeneca’s business model is inherently protected by a wide competitive moat, primarily due to the immense investment and regulatory hurdles involved in pharmaceutical R&amp;D. The company’s continuous innovation in cutting-edge therapeutic modalities and its diversified portfolio of branded drugs across critical disease areas solidify its market position. This strategic focus on science-led innovation and a broad product offering enables AstraZeneca to maintain its leadership and capture new growth opportunities in the evolving healthcare landscape.</p>

<h5 id="3-market--industry-dynamics-3"><strong>3. Market &amp; Industry Dynamics</strong></h5>

<p>AstraZeneca operates within a global healthcare market characterized by significant structural growth drivers and evolving patient needs.</p>

<p><strong>Industry Trends:</strong> The pharmaceutical industry is experiencing transformative trends driven by advancements in science and technology, which are revolutionizing drug discovery and development.22 There is a growing focus on precision medicine, targeted therapies, and leveraging data science and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance R&amp;D capabilities.82 The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and the global aging population are also key drivers for demand in various therapeutic areas.77</p>

<p><strong>Market Size &amp; Growth Potential:</strong> While specific total addressable market (TAM) figures are not explicitly detailed, AstraZeneca’s ambition to achieve $80 billion in Total Revenue by 2030 and launch at least 20 new medicines underscores its belief in significant market growth potential.22 The company operates in large and growing therapeutic areas such as oncology, cardiovascular, renal, metabolic, rare diseases, and respiratory and immunology.77</p>

<p><strong>Customer Base:</strong> AstraZeneca serves a global patient population through healthcare providers, with a focus on addressing unmet medical needs in various disease areas.22 Its broad geographic presence ensures a diverse customer base.</p>

<p>The pharmaceutical industry benefits from inherent structural tailwinds, including an aging global population, the increasing burden of chronic diseases, and continuous scientific advancements. AstraZeneca’s strategic alignment with these trends, particularly its substantial investments in innovative R&amp;D and its focus on developing cutting-edge therapeutic modalities, positions it to capitalize on these long-term growth drivers. The company’s commitment to launching new medicines and achieving ambitious revenue targets by 2030 further indicates its confidence in capturing a significant share of this expanding market. This strategic foresight is expected to fuel sustained growth, regardless of short-term economic fluctuations.</p>

<h5 id="4-competitive-landscape-3"><strong>4. Competitive Landscape</strong></h5>

<p>AstraZeneca operates within a highly competitive global pharmaceutical market, where its strong pipeline and diversified portfolio are key differentiators against major industry players.</p>

<p><strong>Main Competitors:</strong> The pharmaceutical industry is dominated by large, diversified drug manufacturers. Key competitors for AstraZeneca include Eli Lilly and Co (LLY), Merck &amp; Co Inc (MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), AbbVie Inc (ABBV), Novo Nordisk AS (NVO), Roche Holding AG, Novartis AG, Amgen Inc, and Gilead Sciences Inc.77 These companies compete across various therapeutic areas and often have extensive R&amp;D pipelines.</p>

<p><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> When benchmarked against its peers, AstraZeneca’s valuation and profitability metrics provide insights into its competitive standing. Its normalized Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.40 is higher than some competitors like Merck (9.96) but lower than Eli Lilly (38.45).77 Its profitability metrics, including Return on Assets (ROA) of 7.35%, Return on Equity (ROE) of 19.23%, and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 12.08%, are competitive within the industry.77 Simply Wall St estimates AstraZeneca as 70.7% undervalued 70, suggesting a potential disconnect between its intrinsic value and market price.</p>

<p>AstraZeneca’s ability to maintain strong profitability and capital efficiency metrics within a highly competitive landscape, alongside its significant R&amp;D investments and robust pipeline, distinguishes it from many peers. The company’s focus on developing innovative therapies across a diversified portfolio allows it to compete effectively with larger players. The perception of undervaluation by some analysts, despite its strong market position, suggests that the market may not yet fully appreciate the company’s long-term growth potential and the value of its pipeline.</p>

<h5 id="5-contracts-strategic-alliances--geopolitical-factors-3"><strong>5. Contracts, Strategic Alliances &amp; Geopolitical Factors</strong></h5>

<p>AstraZeneca actively engages in strategic alliances and acquisitions to enhance its pipeline and market presence, while navigating geopolitical complexities and trade policies.</p>

<p><strong>Significant Government &amp; Commercial Contracts / Strategic Partnerships:</strong> AstraZeneca is continuously involved in strategic transactions to bolster its portfolio. Recent activities include the acquisition of FibroGen China for approximately $160 million in February 2025.76 Additionally, AstraZeneca plans to acquire EsoBiotec for up to $1 billion, including an initial payment of $425 million, to expand its therapeutic modalities.76 The company also maintains significant collaborations, such as with Daiichi Sankyo, which recently announced positive high-level results from a Phase III trial for Enhertu.70</p>

<p><strong>Geopolitical Exposure:</strong> As a global pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca is exposed to geopolitical shifts, crises, and conflicts, which can impact its operations and the broader economic landscape.79 The company acknowledges that governments are increasingly focused on strategic autonomy, driven by concerns over national security, crisis preparedness, and economic competitiveness.79 While not directly referring to US trade tariffs, CEO Pascal Soriot emphasized AstraZeneca’s firm commitment to investing and growing in the US, highlighting its 11 production sites and two R&amp;D centers in the country.84 The company’s broad-based revenue sources and global manufacturing footprint contribute to its resilience.75</p>

<p>AstraZeneca’s strategy of leveraging strategic alliances and targeted acquisitions is crucial for expanding its pipeline and accelerating the development of new medicines. This proactive approach to business development is a key growth driver. The company’s extensive global footprint and local production capabilities, particularly in the US, provide a degree of mitigation against the direct impacts of geopolitical tensions and trade policies. However, the broader economic and political uncertainties remain a factor that can influence market conditions and supply chains. AstraZeneca’s ability to navigate these complexities while continuing its strategic investments is vital for sustained performance.</p>

<h5 id="6-future-strategy--growth-catalysts-3"><strong>6. Future Strategy &amp; Growth Catalysts</strong></h5>

<p>AstraZeneca’s future strategy is ambitious, aiming for significant growth driven by its innovative pipeline and global expansion.</p>

<p><strong>Management’s Stated Strategy:</strong> AstraZeneca’s “Ambition 2030” sets a clear strategic direction: to be pioneers in science, lead in disease areas, and transform patient outcomes.22 The company is committed to achieving $80 billion in Total Revenue by 2030 and launching at least 20 new medicines, with sustained growth thereafter.22 This strategy is supported by a focus on operating margin expansion, aiming for at least 15 new molecular entities (NMEs) approved by 2030.83</p>

<p><strong>Identifiable Growth Catalysts:</strong> Several factors are expected to drive AstraZeneca’s future growth:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pipeline Innovation:</strong> The company is focused on delivering the “next wave of pipeline innovation” and accelerating its platform of therapeutic modalities.22 This includes over 30 new Phase III trials initiated in 2023, with 10 potential blockbuster medicines.83 Recent positive Phase III readouts (e.g., DESTINY-Breast09 for Enhertu, SERENA-6 for camizestrant, MATTERHORN for Imfinzi) are critical indicators of future commercial success.75</li>
  <li><strong>Transformative R&amp;D Technologies:</strong> Investments in cutting-edge technologies like antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), cell therapy, gene therapy, and next-generation immuno-oncology bispecifics are expected to revolutionize treatments and open new market opportunities.22</li>
  <li><strong>Geographic Expansion:</strong> The company is firmly committed to investing and growing in the US, leveraging its 11 production sites and two large R&amp;D sites.75 Growth in Total Revenue was observed across all major geographic regions in Q1 2025.75</li>
  <li><strong>Disease Area Leadership:</strong> AstraZeneca aims to achieve industry-leading growth in its therapy areas, particularly in Oncology, where it seeks to “eliminate cancer as a cause of death”.22</li>
  <li><strong>Sustainability Integration:</strong> Leading on climate, equity, and resilience, with targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction (98% by end 2025 for Scope 1 and 2, 50% by 2030 for Scope 3) 83, aligns with increasing investor and societal expectations for sustainable business practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>AstraZeneca’s growth strategy is deeply intertwined with its R&amp;D productivity and ability to successfully commercial</p>

as well as another <a href="https://www.marcusfolkesson.se/blog/ubi-volumes-in-yocto/">Marcus Folkesson’s blog</a>.</p>

<p>I <strong>strongly recommend</strong> you to go through <a href="https://www.marcusfolkesson.se/blog/ubi-volumes-in-yocto/">Marcus Folkesson’s blog</a> first,
so that you get a basic idea how to integrate multiple volumes in Yocto for a UBI device.</p>

<p>I utilized his work and started to integrate for a UBI device with two volumes of
squashfs and one volume of overlay in UBIFS.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://swechencheng.github.io/blog/custom-upperdir-in-meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay/">my previous blog</a>,
the reason of picking squashfs is for space efficiency.
Two symmetric dual rootfs (squashfs) and an overlay (ubifs) fit into the limited NAND.
There are good explanations in <a href="http://linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/ubi.html#L_squashfs_over_ubi">squashfs-over-ubi</a> and <a href="http://linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubi.html#L_ubiblock">RO block devices on top of UBI volumes</a>.</p>

<p>I started working on creating custom <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mybui.bblass</code> according to <a href="https://www.marcusfolkesson.se/blog/ubi-volumes-in-yocto/">Marcus Folkesson’s blog</a>.
However, I found out one thing is not really working in Yocto:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need to create our own class in order to override that function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, we need to “override” <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_ubi_config()</code> which is defined in Yocto <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image_types.bbclass</code>.
However, since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_ubi_config()</code> comes from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image_types.bbclass</code>, it is not override-able.</p>

<p>After some debugging, I realized that I need to create a complete <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mybui.bblass</code>
with different naming of functions, which enables a complete build.</p>

<p>Here is a complete example of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mybui.bblass</code>:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>IMAGE_FSTYPES <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"squashfs myubi"</span>

<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And in your actual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-image.bb</code> (suppose your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IMAGE_NAME</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-image</code>), you need to have:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>IMAGE_CLASSES <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"myubi"</span>
inherit core-image myubi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here I am using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">core-image</code> since I only need a bare minimal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">core-image-minimal</code>.
You can choose other image inheritance instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">core-image</code> based on your need.</p>

<p>After <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bitbake my-image</code>, you will find your final rootfs image in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${IMGDEPLOYDIR}</code> named as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${IMAGE_NAME}.myubi</code>.</p>

<p>Since I am working on NXP i.MX device, I can flash the whole UBI image with little <a href="https://github.com/nxp-imx/mfgtools/issues/433#issuecomment-2663403128">uuu ubi customization</a>. And it works much smoother than <a href="https://github.com/nxp-imx/mfgtools/wiki/Sample-scripts#burn-nand-flash-by-linux-kernel"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uuu</code>’s official example</a> with tar extraction.</p>

<p>Hope this little guide will help you when you encounter problems with UBI volume customization in Yocto.</p>

<h2 id="caveat"><strong>Caveat</strong></h2>

<p>In my example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mybui.bblass</code>, I don’t have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ubifs</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IMAGE_FSTYPES</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UBI_IMGTYPE</code>,
this is because my overlay is created dynamically in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ubinize</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vol_type=dynamic</code> and empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image</code> config.</p>

<p>But if you have your own volumes with images which are in UBIFS, then you need to have
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ubifs</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IMAGE_FSTYPES</code>, and correctly define your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MKUBIFS_ARGS</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UBINIZE_ARGS</code>.
And <a href="https://www.marcusfolkesson.se/blog/ubi-volumes-in-yocto/">Marcus Folkesson’s blog</a> has good examples for it.</p>

<p>Another thing is that Yocto default environment variables provides:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>UBI_VOLNAME ?<span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">MACHINE</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">-rootfs"</span>
UBI_VOLTYPE ?<span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"dynamic"</span>
UBI_IMGTYPE ?<span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"ubifs"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But these variables are not particularly useful in our cases since every UBI volume
can have its own volume name, volume type, and image type.
So one set of environment variables cannot not rule out all our needs.
It’s just good enough to define your own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_myubi_config()</code> in detail.</p>]]></content><author><name>Chencheng Zhang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Embedded Linux" /><category term="Yocto" /><category term="NAND" /><category term="UBI" /><category term="squashfs" /><category term="NXP" /><category term="i.MX" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this blog, I will discuss something new I found based on my previous blog, as well as another Marcus Folkesson’s blog.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Custom `upperdir` in meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay</title><link href="/blog/custom-upperdir-in-meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Custom `upperdir` in meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay" /><published>2025-03-24T16:16:33+01:00</published><updated>2025-03-24T16:16:33+01:00</updated><id>/blog/custom-upperdir-in-meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/custom-upperdir-in-meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay/"><![CDATA[<p>I have been working and designing a new Embedded Linux with a brand new upgrade mechanism on an 7-10 year-old legacy Embedded Linux devices which had no atomic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rootfs</code> upgrade mechanism.
the legacy system has a proprietary package manager which is working fine and I have to keep the compatibility with it.
It is a complicated task, however the modern Yocto gives almost everything I need:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/sbabic/meta-swupdate">Stefano Babic’s meta-swupdate</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/marcusfolkesson/meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay">Marcus Folkesson’s meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay</a></li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meta-swupdate</code> gives the whole infrastructure of doing atomic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rootfs</code> upgrades in the future.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay</code> gives the possibility of keeping backward compatibility with legacy system… Sounds too easy is not it?
Oh well, this kind of hybrid design is challenging and complex to manage, but that is not the scope of this blog for now.</p>

<p>Let me come back to the current need:
E.g., if the user has A/B partition scheme: A &amp; B RO rootfs,
but only have one disk/volume for the rootrw due to limited partitioning space,
and the user wants to switch between A/B RO <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rootfs</code> meanwhile keep the overlayfs matching the RO <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rootfs</code> that is being activated,
then the user can define their custom <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upperdir</code> name via kernel <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmdline</code>.</p>

<p>I have made <a href="https://github.com/marcusfolkesson/meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay/pull/8">a PR</a> to make it possible for user to define their own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upperdir</code> location in rootrw.
This gives the user more control over the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upperdir</code>(s) and the possibility to manage multiple versions of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upperdir</code>.</p>

<p>The usage is, e.g. in my particular kernel <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmdline</code>, if the system boots from rootfs A:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">console</span><span class="o">=</span>ttymxc0,115200 ubi.mtd<span class="o">=</span>nandubi ubi.block<span class="o">=</span>0,rootfs0 <span class="nv">root</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/ubiblock0_0 <span class="nv">rootfstype</span><span class="o">=</span>squashfs <span class="nv">rootoptions</span><span class="o">=</span>ro <span class="nv">rootrw</span><span class="o">=</span>ubi0:overlayfs <span class="nv">rootrwfstype</span><span class="o">=</span>ubifs <span class="nv">rootrwoptions</span><span class="o">=</span>rw <span class="nv">rootrwreset</span><span class="o">=</span>no <span class="nv">rootrwupperdir</span><span class="o">=</span>upperdir0 <span class="nv">init</span><span class="o">=</span>/init <span class="nv">mtdparts</span><span class="o">=</span>gpmi-nand:4m<span class="o">(</span>nandboot<span class="o">)</span>,-<span class="o">(</span>nandubi<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the system boots from rootfs B:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">console</span><span class="o">=</span>ttymxc0,115200 ubi.mtd<span class="o">=</span>nandubi ubi.block<span class="o">=</span>0,rootfs1 <span class="nv">root</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/ubiblock0_1 <span class="nv">rootfstype</span><span class="o">=</span>squashfs <span class="nv">rootoptions</span><span class="o">=</span>ro <span class="nv">rootrw</span><span class="o">=</span>ubi0:overlayfs <span class="nv">rootrwfstype</span><span class="o">=</span>ubifs <span class="nv">rootrwoptions</span><span class="o">=</span>rw <span class="nv">rootrwreset</span><span class="o">=</span>no <span class="nv">rootrwupperdir</span><span class="o">=</span>upperdir1 <span class="nv">init</span><span class="o">=</span>/init <span class="nv">mtdparts</span><span class="o">=</span>gpmi-nand:4m<span class="o">(</span>nandboot<span class="o">)</span>,-<span class="o">(</span>nandubi<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just to clarify a bit:
This device have a small raw NAND where the system runs, thus we use underlying MTD partitions and UBI device.
The RO rootfs is running squashfs over UBI block device emulation for saving spaces. And an RW “overlay” sits on top of that.</p>

<p>You can read more how basically it works in <a href="https://www.marcusfolkesson.se/blog/meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay/">Marcus Folkesson’s blog</a>.</p>

<p>Last but not least, people may ask:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to cleanup the old <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upperdir</code>s?
    <ul>
      <li>First choice is to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rootrwreset</code> in <a href="https://github.com/marcusfolkesson/meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#details">meta-readonly-rootfs-overlay Details</a> to clear all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upperdir</code>s.</li>
      <li>But if you have custom requirements such as to retain only certain version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upperdir</code>s, then you have to implement your own logic.</li>

I got a good power supply Aim-TTi MX100TP, which I can have very accurate control over three outputs.
Here is the <a href="https://resources.aimtti.com/manuals/MX100T+MX100TP_Instruction_Manual_EN_48511-1610_8.pdf">manual for MX100TP</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, I found out that MX100TP has a remote control interface. This is great news to me since I am used to setting up everything in the lab to which I can have remote access.
I started with LAN interface. However, after some usage, I found out that the LAN interface is not stable depending on LAN/subnet/firewall situation. It gets impossible to get back to manual control of MX100TP when it goes into remote mode since it has “interface locking”. This sucks once it gets stuck in LAN mode and not reachable. And I have to manually power-toggling it to get back the control.</p>

<p>Since I don’t have full control of the firmware of MX100TP, I decided to switch to a USB/serial interface. Because I usually have a RaspberryPi gateway, which I can hook up with various hardware if interfaces allow. I have full control over the RaspberryPi, and I can completely configure the RaspberryPi OS however I need.</p>

<p>I started searching around to see if there exists any tool/script that can talk to the power supply over a serial line to MX100TP. Surprisingly I found only one <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/75055922/23622431">C# implementation</a>.</p>

<p>I am not so familiar with building and running C# on Linux since it requires Mono framework, and it feels a bit overhead for me.
Thus, I created this little Python script:</p>

<p><cite><a href="https://github.com/swechencheng/power-supply-serial">power-supply-serial</a></cite></p>

<p>The usage is simple:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 ps_serial.py /dev/&lt;serial&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To make life a bit easier, I also created a udev rule in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/udev/rules.d/95-usb-serial.rules</code> for the MX100TP:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="103e", ATTRS{idProduct}=="04ba", ATTRS{serial}=="425410", SYMLINK+="usbserial.powersupply"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This creates /dev/usbserial.powersupply so that I don’t have to remember the serial port number. And the command becomes:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 ps_serial.py /dev/usbserial.powersupply
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you can send the commands to MX100TP according to the command list in the manual, e.g.:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Enter a command (or 'quit' to exit): OP1?
Response: 0
Enter a command (or 'quit' to exit): OP1 1
Response:
Enter a command (or 'quit' to exit): OP1?
Response: 1
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It also remembers command history which you can use up down arrow to resume a previous command.</p>

<p>Hope this little script can help to make your life a little bit easier!</p>]]></content><author><name>Chencheng Zhang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="hardware" /><category term="power supply" /><category term="serial port" /><category term="Linux" /><category term="Python" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with embedded devices, I need to control, e.g. voltage and current on some test point.
